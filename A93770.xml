            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS you were obedient in my abſence while I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from you for a ſeaſon, ſo I have endeavored ſince my return, that the Truth of the Goſpel might continue with you; and therefore have I not given place, by ſubjection, no not for an hour, to any that have attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to bring another Goſpel among you, though there is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but there be ſome that have troubled others, and would, by perverting the Goſpel, have troubled you alſo; Yet bleſſed and praiſed be God who hath kept you in the hour of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and helped you to keep the Word of his Patience, and not deny his Name.</p>
            <p>That you and yours may ever be preſerved, when this my earthly tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, I have drawn up this <hi>REPLY,</hi> and do commend it to your diligent peruſal, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging you in the Lord, that you redeem ſome time for the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; eſpecially, ſuch of you as have allowed ſpare hours for the reading of the Adverſaries Pamphlets.</p>
            <p>It is above a year ſince the firſt of the Sect, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> came into the Town, and ſcattered his opinions. You had then cautions given you from the Lord.

Beware of wheeling to the right hand, or to the left. Take heed what you hear, and how you hear. Beware of the leaven of the Quaking Phariſees and Sadduces. It argues weakneſs at the beſt, and childiſhneſs in the beſt, if they be toſſed to and fro with every wind of doctrine. Children will run after a bubble in the wind, or on the water; a feather on the ground, or froth upon the waves: Be not like them, or as giddy hearers that have no mould but what the next Novelliſt caſts them into. Diverſe and ſtrange doctrines (ſuch as theſe men I deal with eſpecially open out of their packs) tend much to the unſetling of the judgement, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet<note place="margin">John 10. 5.</note> of the conſcience.

               </gap>ficial againſt all diſtracting opinions, to have your ſouls and conſciences eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the doctrine, faith and ſenſe of Gods free Favor in Chriſt, and with the experimental exerciſe of Grace in Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip. 1. The doctrine of his redeeming, purchaſing grace, his pardoning of ſinners, and reconciling them to himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his free electing love, eſtabliſheth againſt the thoughts of our greateſt unworthineſs; for the free gift of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs for juſtification of life, reigneth over all your guilt, and the deſign of Grace is to bring all that obey the doctrine of Grace, into a kingdom of Grace, and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a crown of Life, and Glory upon the poor unworthy ſinner. Hold faſt to this, as not onely it is free, but full. The Goſpel of our ſalvation is ſo full, as it anſwereth all the ſouls neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; partly, from the fulneſs of the perſon the Son of God, our Savior, God and man, in whom the fulneſs of the Godhead dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth bodily; If there be all-ſufficiency of power, love, will, faithfulneſs in God to ſave, 'tis in Chriſt, yea, the fulneſs of Gods vindicative Juſtice is ſatisfied and glorified in him. This
<pb facs="tcp:115729:7"/> we teach for your heart-ſatisfaction and ſettlement: partly from the fulneſs of the covenant, whereby God makes over Chriſt and Life to us, which is heart-eſtabliſhing, as 'tis foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the blood of Chriſt, as it is the efflux and iſſue of Gods everlaſting love, as all the promiſes are Yea, and Amen in Chriſt, and as the Covenant is of the nature of a Teſtament (which is more abſolute then ordinary contracts) in full force<note place="margin">Heb 9. 16.</note> by the death of the Teſtator, written not onely in the Scriptures [the Old Copy and the New] but in the hearts of Believers.<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 10.</note> God begins with promiſes and writes them, and then his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are all inlayed and inamel'd with the promiſes. This<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17.</note> Covenant is confirmed by an Oath, to ſhew the immutability of his counſel, and to ſettle the hearts and hopes of them, that flee thither for refuge, with ſtrong conſolation. In a word, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace excludes works, as any condition of life, for it is the declaration of Gods way of ſaving by Grace, according to the Election of Grace; which if it be of Grace (as it is) then<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 6.</note> is it not at all of works. Theſe meditations are heart-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you will ſay, in wavering times; and all Doctrines agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the fulneſs of Chriſt and his Covenant, are ſo. <hi>David</hi> found it ſo, ſo may you. It was a ſoft pillow to <hi>David [God</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 23 5.</note> 
               <hi>hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure]</hi> on his Death-bed, whereon to reſt his head, ſo it will be to all that take hold on it, and mix it with faith: For, ſecondly, it is not the Doctrine of the Goſpel abſtractly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as believed, that will eſtabliſh you. Faith eſtabliſheth<note place="margin">Col. 1. 23.</note> by its object, acts, reflections and fruits. Continue in the faith grounded and ſetled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel which ye have heard. Conſider, brethren, what you believe, and in whom ye have believed. Chriſt and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs <hi>without you,</hi> is a ſure foundation for your Faith to<note place="margin">Iſaiah 28. 18.</note> build upon: He that believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled, beaten off. Faith gives you an evidence of things not ſeen, and makes things abſent, preſent. Every act of Faith tends to your eſtabliſhment, having ſome certainty in its boſom and bowels, and ſo much as ſtrives againſt doubting, and that ſhall not miſcarry in the iſſue and event: But reflections of Faith help on yet more to ſtedfaſtneſs; When you know you do<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> believe, then you have the anſwer of a good conſcience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="tcp:115729:8"/> comes peace and liberty; Peace with God is diſcerned, and peace with Conſcience is ſetled hereby in much ſerenity, with liberty of acceſs to the Throne of Grace, and of making your Appeals to God, by vertue of Chriſts blood ſprinkled on the Conſcience, and by reaſon of the Acquittance which Chriſt received for the Believer at his reſurrection; His diſcharge is ours, and hence the other benefits which Faith brings along with it, of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, Communion with God, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Redemption, Adoption and Sanctification. But if with the Doctrine and Faith of the Goſpel, there comes thirdly, the Grace of ſenſe, or the ſenſe of Gods grace and love in all that is taught and believed, how is the heart eſtabliſhed by the holy<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> Spirit that is given us? This Spirit is both the ſeal of what is paſt, the witneſs of what is preſent, and the earneſt of what is to come; making all that is in reverſion as ſure to us, as that which is already in our poſſeſsion. Adde unto this, fourthly, Experimental exerciſe of grace in all Goſpel-inſtitutions, and what eſtabliſhment ſhall your hearts want now or hereafter? Communion with God in Goſpel-Ordinances gives reſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, when we finde the effect of Water-baptiſm, and of Infant-baptiſm in Chriſts blood, and the Spirits regeneration; when we diſcern the effect of Bread and Wine-Lords-ſupper in Chriſts preſence at his Table; and the quicknings of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our ſinging <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms and Scripture-ſpiritual ſongs, uſe of publique (as private) Prayer, miniſtery of the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your ſouls, brethren, cannot but finde it eminently helpful to be <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> with this Goſpel-grace: Firſt, you have here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by an Antidote againſt all poiſon of diverſe and ſtrange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. Your hearts are as ſhips well-ballaſted againſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds. The Doctrine of Free-grace, rightly underſtood, believed and adhered to, doth at once diſpel and ſcatter all Popiſh and Arminian fogs. The fulneſs of Chriſt believed, lays open the emptineſs of Quakeriſm. The Covenant and Promiſes, graſped by Faith, are as the little ſtone, which, they ſay, the Bee takes up to flie with in a high wind, ſo as the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt blaſts ſhall not daſh you to the ground. Let who will ſay, that Chriſt doth not juſtifie by a righteouſneſs <hi>without us,</hi> the Scripture ſaith, We are made the righteouſneſs of God <hi>in him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:115729:8"/> and the Grace of Faith carries out the Soul for righteouſneſs and life in another, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt: of this the Spirit, with the Conſcience and Experience of Believers beareth witneſs. Let the poor Quakers ſay that the Scriptures are not the word of God; the heart, that believeth and experienceth the power of the Scripture changing and transforming, will finde him a liar and blaſphemer. Let them ſay that will, they have no ſin dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, and their warfare is at an end; a gracious heart will ſlight and deſpiſe theſe Contradictions to all the Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Saints held forth in Scripture. Let them ſay there is no Baptiſm of water, or let them call the Lords Supper (as uſed by the Churches) a humane Invention, becauſe they have found no comfort in it, or by it; the heart eſtabliſhed in the faith of the Inſtitution, will give them the lie; and although he findes not theſe ſeals always alike efficacious, yet he knows and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth them always to be the Lords Ordinances, and to have a promiſe of efficacy annexed to them, which God will make good at his day and hour, and not at our ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The fears which falſe doctrine terrifieth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience withal are removed, and made to vaniſh. Fears of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance by reaſon of daily failings in duties; fears of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away totally and finally, are expelled by the pure doctrine of faith, and of juſtification by grace alone, and by nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us, as a habit, or adherent to us, as an act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is this advantage, all pretended Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are caſt off, dreams are not hearkned unto, leading from the Scriptures. The faith of a Promiſe makes things as ſure to your ſouls, as if God had ſpoken immediately from the Clouds. The ſenſe of Gods Love is as ſweet as a rapture into the third Heavens. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets are as ſure to a gracious heart, as if one aroſe from the dead; for he could not bring up greater Truths or ſtronger Arguments of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion then are found in the Scriptures; he could not ſpeak more pathetically, with higher ſtrains, and ſtronger lines, with more majeſty of ſtile, and elegancy of phraſe, or ſweeter floods of eloquence, or with more plainneſs and godly ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, then the Spirit expreſſeth himſelf in the Scripture, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth all along an evidence and demonſtration of himſelf, with holy harmony and efficacy.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:115729:9"/>
            <p>Fourthly, When your hearts are eſtabliſhed with Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious Doctrine, Faith, Senſe and Experience thereof, you are fortified against all powerful temptations. Sometime the ſoul is tempted to forſake Ordinances, but faith of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall not ſeek God in vain, keeps<note place="margin">Iſaiah 45. 19.</note> the heart cloſe to means of Gods appointment. Sometime the Chriſtian is tempted to go to a ſecond Baptiſm, or to deny Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-baptiſm altogether; but the Experience of Chriſts bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Infant-Baptiſm, and the un-warrantableneſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization keeps him from theſe extremities. If you be tempted to abſent your ſelves from the Lords Table, or leave Church-fellowſhip, the Promiſe and Experience of the Love of God in the uſe of theſe Ordinances, aws and keeps you in order. When Chriſt, until his ſecond Coming in the clouds, and viſible Glory, is lookt at as ſpiritually preſent with his own Inſtitutions, they are neither truſted to, nor neglected. Sometime you have been tempted to go hear known Seducers, but an eſtabliſht heart will not ſtep out of doors, unleſs he hath the more ſpecial call, to bear witneſs againſt them, and to ſtrengthen others.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Let your hearts be eſtabliſht with Goſpel-grace, and it will produce a well-ordered converſation to the end of your days; it will make patient in affliction; joyful in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; even under darkneſs and in deſertion the heart is willing to wait, and is made ready for Heaven; for it ſtirs up to watchfulneſs, to have grace in exerciſe, and the ſoul in preparation for death, and then it cannot want boldneſs at the day of Chriſts appearing.</p>
            <p>Why then, my Brethren, dearly Beloved, and longed after, my joy and crown, ſo ſtand faſt in the Lord, my dearly Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; ſee that none of you fail of the grace of God; Be not as reeds ſhaken with the wind, but as unſhaken rocks and pillars in your profeſsion. Prize and preſs after more of heart-eſtabliſhing grace; to this end, Hold faſt the purity of Doctrine about Juſtification, Election, Redemption, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and the whole pattern of ſound and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom words in the Scriptures, and in the Churches Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Faith conſonant to the Scriptures. Be active in faith upon the Author and Finiſher of your Salvation. Be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb facs="tcp:115729:9"/> to the Spirit, who witneſſeth and ſealeth the Truth, and ſheds abroad the Love of God in your hearts. Make much of your Experiences, built upon and backt with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: cry not woe unto them, as ſome upon their revolting to Quakeriſm have done. Set before you the example of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chriſtians, as ſo many <hi>Jerome's,</hi> ſtanding like old well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooted Oaks, and breaking the winds of Doctrines and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which aſſault them on every ſide. Decline infectious company: ceaſe to hear the inſtruction that cauſeth to erre from the words of knowledge: Beware of a blinde-zealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affecting of any man. Take heed of curioſity, and a itching deſire of Novelty, or of knowing any new way to Chriſt and Heaven? Stand in the paths and enquire for the old and the good way, that ye may walk therein. Maintain a humble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, daily abaſed in the ſight and ſenſe of heart ſinfulneſs and inſtability: The Lord will teach and root the humble. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a clear Conſcience in profeſſion and communion with the Saints and Churches. The myſtery of Faith is held in a pure Conſcience; when men put away a good Conſcience, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a natural Conſcience before a Conſcience purified by Faith, they make ſhipwrack of the doctrine of Faith. Let Gods power be lookt after, in and with Gods own Form. The Kingdom of God may be <hi>among</hi> men, when 'tis not <hi>within</hi> their hearts; ſo <hi>Luke 17. 21.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaketh to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, enemies of his Goſpel; The kingdom of God is <hi>among</hi>

They madly wreſt the reading of the words [within you] who apply it to a Kingdom of Grace begun, in the enemies of Chriſt, by the light in every man, and would thereupon have all Christs outward Forms, and poſitive Inſtitutions laid aſide; But what God hath joyned together, power and form (where and to whom he pleaſeth) do not you ſeparate You have not hitherto been like theſe ſheep which eat no graſs more greedily then that which rots them. If our new Teachers, and their diſciples boaſt of an aſtoniſhing Power coming along with their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, remember <hi>2 Cor. 6. 7. The word of Truth, and the Power of God</hi> (whereby Christs Miniſters are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved)
<pb facs="tcp:115729:10"/> do go together. If power goes forth with a word of falſhood, 'tis Antichriſts power, which is after the working of Satan, not the Lords. It will be ſad with any Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, under Gods inſtitution and form, to fall ſhort of his<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 9.</note> power: But while you uſe his Ordinances in Faith of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſts power annexed to them, you are and ſhall be more wrought up to, and brought under the power promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And that I may be partaker of the Goſpel-power, as Priviledges with you; yea, that this Reply (as weak as it is) may be accompanied (according to the truth of it) with the mighty power of the Lord, Let it be your prayer, as it is and ſhall be mine, who am, through grace,</p>

            <p>As you are <hi>judicious,</hi> and grown up to mature and manly knowledge, I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I wrote before, and now write again. Many Charges my adverſary caſteth upon me in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as ſo many fiery darts; I liſt not to recriminate, but have undertaken to make good my Collection of the Contradictions at firſt found among this ſort and Sect of men. Judge ye whether I have <hi>wronged</hi> any mans books, or <hi>mixed my deceit</hi> with them? Judge ye whether I have violated any of Gods Precepts or Truths, and taught men ſo?

            <p>The reaſon of this my Reply is not any conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wrong done to <hi>Richard Farnworth,</hi> nor of any injury I have done to the Truth and Cauſe of God: What Mr. <hi>Tindal</hi> writes in an Epiſtle to <hi>John Frith</hi> concerning his Tranſlation of the New Teſtament (ſo vilified by his Adverſaries) that I can ſay, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to my dealing with Gods Scripture, and their Scriblings, <hi>I call God to record againſt the day we ſhall appear before our Lord Ieſus, to give up a reckoning of our doings, that I never altered one ſyllable againſt my conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. But I muſt follow the call and ducture of his providence; <hi>R.

            <p>For the direction of my Reader, I have a few things to prefix. All that concerneth any paſſages in my former piece (which <hi>R.

What remaineth in his Epiſtle, is but an Invective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scots; where he fights in the dark, or with his own ſhadow, fancying me, becauſe I was in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (at that juncture of time) to be a Scot, and often in his book he lets flie againſt them of that Nation for my ſake: But what is Chriſts Goſpel in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> (as elſwhere) I am not aſhamed of: what I preached there, or what the Scots affirm there of the Scriptures, and Doctrines conſonant thereunto, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm with them.</p>
            <p>The method I follow is after my former piece, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeveral miſcellaneous Heads, and Sections, of their Scripture and Self-contradictions. The word [Contradiction] I uſe in the Scripture phraſe, in the largeſt and moſt Theological ſenſe, for gainſayings, as in <hi>Acts 13. 45. Titus</hi> 1. 9.<note place="margin">

            <p>Some ſtrengthning to their fort of <hi>Babel</hi> our Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have received from the followers of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi> who call <hi>Nature, Grace,</hi> as theſe mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Natures light, and call it <hi>Chriſt within them:</hi> who call the Notions of the Godhead the <hi>Elements</hi> and <hi>firſt Rudiments of Salvation,</hi> as theſe call them the <hi>firſt Principles of Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Corner-ſtone.</hi> How come they to lead men from the Scriptures to the Creatures, but that ſome had ſaid before them, Chriſt was and is preached in the Sun, Moon and Stars? And again, how come they to ſay, <hi>We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how the Goſpel of Chriſt is preached to every creature under heaven, if it be not the Principle of light in the conſcience,</hi> if they were not acted by the ſame ſpirit? Or, how ſay they, <hi>produce one Scripture that ſpeaks of a natural light,</hi> if they had not read or heard of ſome Arminian dictate to this purpoſe, <hi>viz. The Scripture knows not the word [natural] in any ſuch ſenſe or ſignification, wherein it ſhould expreſs
<pb facs="tcp:115729:16"/> or diſtinguiſh the unregenerate ſtate of a man from the regenerate.</hi> How do they jump in one minde concerning <hi>Peters</hi> being out of the ſtate of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he denied his Maſter? and about the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Rom</hi> 7. from <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to the end of the Chapter, underſtanding it of a man unregenerate, in conflict with a natural conſcience, and not ſimply of one regenerate in combat with corruption of nature, in every faculty of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>How far the ſpirit of Antichriſt works in theſe men, God will yet farther diſcover, and what Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical Plots and Deſigns there are carried on by ſome of them unwittingly, by others as wickedly as wittingly, the day ſhall declare it. And if any will take the pains to compare their Pamphlets, with the Charge which Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> drew up about forty years<note place="margin">Supplement to <hi>Synopſis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſmi.</hi>
               </note> by-paſt, againſt the Papiſts, he ſhall finde that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm is built upon the <hi>Tetraſtylon,</hi> or four-fold Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Papiſtry, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Sarcaſms, ſlanders, railings and forgeries. 2. Flat blaſphemies and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Scripture. 3. Looſe arguments, weak ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. 4. Repugnant opinions and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among themſelves, in all, leaving the conſciences of people upon the Rack, or full of doubts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties. For the undermining of which Pillars, the learned and unlearned, the ſimple and judicious, are alarum'd.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to a more aſſiduous and ſtudious reading of the Scriptures. Get you Bibles, 'tis your Souls phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, ſaid <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> of old, to the people his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. There is no greater torment to the devils then to ſee men buſied about the Scriptures, ſaid <note n="*" place="margin">Orig.</note> another before him; But becauſe it is as much pleaſure to the devils to ſee men abuſe and wreſt the Scriptures, ye are called Beloved.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:115729:17"/>
            <p>Secondly, to the owning of them in their juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, above all Teſtimonies of ancient Writers and modern Authors, who were but men, ſubject to infirmities in the head, as heart; Above the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Teſtimony, which gives no authority to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but onely declare what is intrinſecally ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them; Above the teſtimony of your own hearts and conſciences, which muſt receive a true judgement from the right underſtanding and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Scripture; bove all viſions and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which if falſe, draw from the voice of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, if true, they ſend you thither as to your Rule, and a more ſtanding Rule, and above all the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets of the Quakers, now ſwelled to above two volumes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to a dependence upon the Spirit ſpeaking in the Scriptures, to ſeal up their Authority to you, and to give the efficacy of what you read and hear. Gods Spirit breathes in good mens books, much more in his own, and is there as to ſeal up the truth of his Word, ſo to ſtamp the goodneſs of every truth upon our hearts.</p>
            <p>As for this <hi>Reply,</hi> what you finde therein agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Spirit of God his language, of plain and naked Scripture-truth, receive in the love of it, and give God the glory.

            <head>THE Reviler rebuked. OR A Reply to R. FARNWORTH HIS INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I can fall upon the Subject of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies between me and my Antagoniſt, I muſt touch at his Introduction wherein he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his receiving of my Book renews his charge againſt me, gives a ſeeming proof of his charge, and concludes with a Thundering Anathema.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What he received, <hi>A Printed Paper</hi> (as he calls it ſlightingly) <hi>that came out of</hi> Scotland <hi>into</hi> York <hi>and</hi> Yorkſhire <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>publiſhed by one</hi> John Stalham, <hi>Preacher of the Goſpel at</hi> Edinburgh. That little piece, of three ſheets and a half, <hi>J. S.</hi> owneth, as publiſhed by him, and that he called himſelf <hi>Preacher of the Goſpel at</hi> Edinburgh (<hi>for the preſent,</hi> as was inſerted) it was becauſe for ſome time, he had been, and then continued preaching of the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt, to his Auditors, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 29. with other Scriptures; And for as much as that great truth of the Goſpel was openly oppoſed by one of the Sect, called Quakers, touching the juſtification of a believing ſinner, he was called to enquire after the opinions of the ſaid Sect, and to draw up his collections from divers of their Pamphlets, which he referred unto ſeveral Heads of their Scripture and Self-contradictions, wherein he is,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:115729:18"/>
            <p>Secondly, Charged by <hi>R. F.</hi> to have <hi>manifeſted himſelf, and his ſubtile ſerpentine Spirit, by his lies and ſlanders, for all his gloſſes and covers, to be a miniſter of deceit, and ſo of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> of all this, or any part of it, <hi>J. S.</hi> is no ways conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor of <hi>his falſly accuſing the people of the Lord</hi> (ſuppoſe any people of the Lord be fallen into the errors and opinions of the Quakers, as he is charitably jealous ſome are ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed therewith) nor of <hi>ſhewing forth a bitter ſpirit of envy againſt them and the truth.</hi> The Lord knows he loveth all the people of the Lord, for the Truths ſake that dwelleth in them, and pitieth thoſe who are over-run with theſe errors (as with a running Itch, or ſore) as he himſelf would be loved and pitied, who is not abſolutely free of error; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the particular fruit is not (in theſe matters of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference) viſible to him; yet the root of all error, as of all ſin, is in him, and ſeen by him, not throughly in all degrees mortified. <hi>As for any of his painted and deckt Notions, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and Contra-diſtinctions, his gilded, coloured, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, and form'd up imagined Expreſſions,</hi> he thinketh <hi>R. F.</hi> had a minde to pleaſe himſelf, and ſome of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with ſeeming ſhadows of Rhetorick, which <hi>J. S.</hi> never affected, but clothed all he wrote with a familiar, home-ſpun ſtile, as he ſhall, this Reply.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The ſeeming proof of the Charge is, That, with the Light, <hi>John 8. 12. John 1. 9. R. F.</hi> thinketh <hi>J. S.</hi> is <hi>ſeen and known to be one that hates it;</hi> and why? 1. <hi>He bears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of himſelf againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles:</hi> Let that be found in any paſſage of his former, or preſent piece, and <hi>R. F.</hi> ſhall be no falſe Apoſtle; <hi>J. S.</hi> will hide his head in a hole, or openly recant the folly and wickedneſs. 2. He calls the <hi>true light</hi> (ſaith R. F.) <hi>the Light of nature, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Light of reaſon:</hi> Where's the proof of this allegation? <hi>J. S.</hi> doth peremptorily deny, that he ever ſo expreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſince he had the Light of reaſon in him. The true Light (as 'tis printed both in <hi>R. F.</hi> his Book <note n="*" place="margin">Page 2.</note>, and in the Bible, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. with a great [<hi>L</hi>] and there ſpoken of) is Chriſt: <hi>J. S.</hi> never called <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Light of <hi>nature,</hi> or the <hi>common Light of reaſon,</hi> (or <hi>reaſon,</hi> as <hi>Page 34. R. F.</hi> cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreth and clattereth.) Haply, he may ſay again and again,
<pb facs="tcp:115729:19"/> That Chriſt, as the very God, and the true Light, giveth the Light of nature to all men, and common light of reaſon (more or leſs) to every man: for he is able to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Donor and his Gift; betwixt the un-created Light-living God, and created Light-given, before the fall, to <hi>Adam;</hi> or given back ſince the fall to him and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. If <hi>R. F.</hi> or any man will confound Chriſt-giving, or enlightning, with the Light-given, or lighted up as a Candle in every man, he may as well confound God and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and make them (as ſome blaſphemouſly imagine) to be one and the ſame Eſſence. Therefore, as in this, ſo in all other inſtances,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>J. S.</hi> is confident (after <hi>R. F.</hi> his impudence in his Preface and Proceedings) he ſhall neither be found Lyar nor falſe Accuſer; but, as he is ſure that Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema was out long ſince, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. and is ſtill in force againſt thoſe that preach another Goſpel-way of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as do theſe Quaking-Papiſts, or Popiſh-Quakers; ſo the Anathema, Maran-atha, that <hi>R. F.</hi> denounceth impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and imperiouſly [<hi>Let him be an Anathema, Maran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atha</hi>] againſt <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall be as the curſe cauſleſs, that ſhall not come; but that God will do him more good, as already he hath done ſomething for him, by <hi>Shimei</hi>'s railing. <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Sectaries, Seducers, and Hereticks</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid) <hi>do nothing elſe but drive us unto the Bible, to make us read more diligently therein, and with more fervency to ſharpen our Prayers;</hi> and I may adde, (by their buffetings) to be more taken off from ſelf-eſtimation, and to be viler in our own eyes, then we can be in the eyes of our Adverſaries, who know not our hearts.</p>

                     <p>THe holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> (by one thunder-ſtricken in ſpirit, and blaſted in profeſſion with the Quakers Books and company in <hi>Scotland</hi>) were denied to my face <hi>to be the word of Truth;</hi> which I noted as the firſt and great Contradiction. <hi>R. Farnworth</hi> in anſwer returns me thus much of truth in form of words, <hi>That the Scriptures are words that proceeded from the Spirit of Truth, we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but own, and ſo they are the words of truth.</hi> Plainly he doth not ſay, they are the words of truth, nor plainly joyn<note place="margin">Scripture the word of truth to all.</note> iſſue with him that denied them to be the word of truth: but if they be own'd for <hi>words of truth, as proceeding from the Spirit of truth,</hi> then, for the advantage of Truth I argue:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are the word of God, and ſo ſhould be owned. by them. Surely the Spirit of truth is the Spirit of God, proceeding from the Father and the Son, and theſe three<note place="margin">John 15. 26.</note> being one, their word is one. That which is the word of the Spirit of truth, is the word of the Father of truth, and of the Son of truth. The Scripture by <hi>R. F.</hi> his confeſſion is the word of the Spirit of truth, therefore he muſt grant it to be the word of the Father, and of the Son of truth; and conſequently, the word of the true God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If they be words of truth, as proceeding from the Spirit of truth, then they are the Rule, Standard, and Touchſtone of truth: the true Spirit being known by his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115729:20"/> words, and directing us to know his minde by his words, what we ſhould believe as truth, and practiſe as truth, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it; but we ſhall anon hear <hi>R. F.</hi> denying the Scriptures to be the rule of a Chriſtian, as of other men that are unchriſtian.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If they be the words of the Spirit of truth, then they are ſo to all men, or but to ſome men.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If ſo to all men that have the Scriptures by them, then why doth not <hi>R. F.</hi> challenge him that <hi>denied them</hi> to be ſo to <hi>unbelievers,</hi> as I noted in my Book? Why doth he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge me for falſhood? with a <hi>therefore</hi> too <note n="*" place="margin">Page 2.</note> [<hi>therefore thy ſaying is falſe.</hi>] What ſaying of mine is falſe, and wherefore? I truly related what I had, from him I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, in diſcourſe once and again, <hi>That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were not the word of truth:</hi> And doth it follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>R. F.</hi> acknowledgeth them to be the words of truth, that, <hi>therefore</hi> I heard not the contradiction, or miſ-related what was ſpoken?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If they be the words of truth but to ſome men, (<hi>not at all to wicked men and unbelievers, no not condemningly,</hi> as were his expreſſions) then it ſeems, the unbelief and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of men, doth make the Faith or Truth of God of none effect: but S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3. 3. is of another minde;<note place="margin">Rom 3. 3. cleared.</note> yea, the Spirit there (by the Interrogation firſt and ſecond, <hi>What if ſome did not believe? ſhall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect?</hi>) forcibly denieth the fruſtration or making void of Gods word of truth, by the Jews former or following continued unbelief. God hath laid his faith and truth to pawn (as it were) in the holy Scriptures, and as he is a God of truth, his word is a word of truth, taking hold of men by the threatning (as <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 6.) who miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe or reject the promiſe. And, <hi>Is he the God of the Jews onely, and not alſo of the Gentiles?</hi> to juſtifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all that are believing or unbelieving, according to the Scriptures? Such therefore who will ſay, No more is the truth of God or word of God to me then what I believe, (were they never ſo dear friends) muſt be as roundly taken up and faithfully rebuked, as ſometimes <hi>Luther</hi> took up a man of no mean account, <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>Bullenger,</hi> you erre, you know
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115729:20"/> neither your ſelf nor what you hold. According to your falſities, if the Word findes not the Spirit, but an ungodly Perſon, then it is not Gods word: whereby you define and hold the word, not according to God who ſpeaketh it, but according as people do entertain and receive it.

F.</hi> will but underſtand what is, and may be ſaid to be the ground of a thing, he may poſſibly believe I know the Saints ground of acting, as they are Saints. The word [Ground] is ambiguous, and hath divers acceptions. In ſtrict propriety of ſpeech, the Earth we tread upon, and Ground are all one, as the ſame Ground or Earth brings forth the ſame fruit. By a metaphorical Alluſion, the word [Ground] is ſometime put for the Cauſe of a thing; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for the firſt ground-work of a Building, or for the firſt Principles and Rules of Art and Science, or for the firſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in a man, of his actings. The Cauſe, and that [princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal-efficient] Ground of the Saints acting, is God, and the Father, by Chriſt through the Spirit. The Scriptures are<note place="margin">How the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the Ground of the Saints acting.</note> inſtrumentally a Cauſe without which, ſince the Lord cauſed them to be given forth, he doth not ordinarily act upon the Saints, or draw forth their acts of grace and godlineſs. They are the firſt external ground-work of all their faith and workings, as Saints: They are the Rule and Warrant of all their ordinary actings, yea, the grounding Touch-ſtone of all extraordinary Impulſes and Revelations. By their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they are a ſufficient ground or reaſon of our faith and practice. The Scripture-commands are one ground, the Scripture-promiſes another, the Scripture-threatnings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the Scripture examples (backt by, and bottom'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a precept) another, the Scripture-Prophecies and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations another. As every word of God is pure, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 5. ſo every part of the Scripture is a pure grounding-rule for a Saints faith and converſation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 14. The wall of the City, the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (made up of Saints indeed) hath twelve foundations: and in them the names of the Apoſtles of the Lamb, whoſe writings we have (with the doctrine

It is true in propriety of Grammar-ſpeech, a letter is but the leaſt part of a word, yet it is a part: But the Bible conſiſts of many books of letters, which God hath left written for his friends and people, to be grounded and ſetled in the faith; yet becauſe <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. ſpeaks of God the Word, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. of the Lord the Spirit, therefore Chriſt and the Scripture muſt not be called by the ſame name; and becauſe Chriſt and the Spirit are inſeparable, therefore the Spirit and the Scripture muſt be parted, as to the Caſe in hand; and if the Spirit be the ground of the Saints acting, the Scriptures muſt have no part nor lot in this buſineſs.

But haply I might have ſpared this pains, in reference to <hi>R.

Onely I muſt advertiſe him and others, that I know none in <hi>Scotland</hi> that ſo affirm, or expreſs themſelves as he ſpeaks: They may ſay, and ſay truly, that the Letter, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Scriptures (which never were without their true ſenſe, nor without the Spirit breathing in them, though it be not manifeſted to every one that reads them, nor a like manifeſtation given at all times to all the Saints) are the onely viſible and legible Rule of faith, and Judge of Controverſies: as all ſound Proteſtants have hitherto maintained this truth againſt the Papiſts. And they that are of a ſound minde in this <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſle (as in all <hi>Europe</hi> and the world) have (from Gods Authority ſtampt upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) aſſerted them to be a <hi>true Ground of the Believers faith,</hi> which <hi>R. F.</hi> weakly denies, <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt.</note> becauſe <hi>Chriſt is the true Ground of faith,</hi> whereas the affirmative is hereby the more ſtrongly proved; For the true adaequate or proportionable Object of faith, is the true Ground of faith; but Chriſt ſpeaking in the Scriptures, is the true adaequate Object of faith; therefore Chriſt in the Scriptures is the true Ground of faith: And thus again, If Chriſt be the true Ground of faith, then the Scriptures of Chriſt, which are his written truth, are a true Ground of faith; as if the man be honeſt, I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115729:35"/> may build upon his word; ſo if Chriſt be true, and Truth itſelf, his word is true, and the truth (as his Fathers word is, <hi>John</hi> 17. 17.) when written down for a more certain ground, as to us, and our actings, then if but ſpoken in the air, or to the ear. Let <hi>R.

Will <hi>R. F.</hi> or any ſay, If our truſt muſt be in the Lord, we are not then to ground our faith on the Scriptures? I muſt tell him from Chriſt, that the not grounding a mans faith upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is an evidence that he grounds it not upon the Lord: the very Scriptures will accuſe ſuch to be unbelievers; for thus our Lord reaſoneth againſt the Jews, <hi>John 5. 45, 46.

Secondly, that the holy Ghoſt is, and how he is, one of the three, I cannot open any of the ſix Texts which I quoted, but the latter will be proved by the former; onely in clearing the latter by it ſelf, <hi>R. F.</hi> his Hereſie and Blaſphemy will be yet more evident and notorius. To the firſt then, I argue thus in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                     <p>If the Scripture ſpeaks of three [the Father, Son, and Spirit] that are one, and yet three, then they are as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly three in their Perſons, as they are undividedly one in their Eſſence.</p>
                     <p>But the Scripture ſpeaks of theſe three that are one, and<note place="margin">There is a Trinity, or three perſons in one God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from and by the Scriptures.</note> yet three.</p>
                     <p>Therefore they are as diſtinctly three in their perſons, as they are undividedly one in their Eſſence. The conſequence of the propoſition is thus proved;</p>
                     <p>When the Scripture ſpeaks of theſe three, either it is to be underſtood of three diſtinct ways of Being, or of three diſtinct Beings; But it cannot be underſtood of three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Beings, for the Lord our God is <hi>One; I am,</hi> or <hi>Being of himſelf;</hi> Therefore it is to be underſtood of three diſtinct maners, or ways of Being, each of which maners of Being is no other but that which the Scripture expreſſeth by the word Hypoſtaſis, or Perſon, when it ſometime ſpeaks of one of the three, ſometime of another. The Aſſumption is clear from the Scriptures that either expreſly ſay, <hi>there are three,</hi> and theſe <hi>are one,</hi> or reckon up <hi>three</hi> neither more, nor fewer; coequal, and of the ſame dignity, as co-eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and of the ſame Deity.

                     <p>But the holy Spirit is diſtinguiſhed from the Father, and from the Son, by his ineffable maner of being, or by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative incommunicable property of ſubſiſting in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: Therefore he is one of the divine perſons.</p>
                     <p>That the holy Spirit is diſtinguiſhed by his ineffable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of being, and relative incommunicable property of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the God-head, is clear from that one Scripture (among others above cited) <hi>John</hi> 15. 26. In theſe words [which proceedeth from the Father] and in many Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures he is called the Spirit of the Son, and the Spirit of Chriſt, and therefore he proceedeth from him alſo, and is known thereby to be a diſtinct perſon from him, and from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115729:44"/> the Father. If any ſay, this doctrine of the Trinity is very myſterious, make it out by ſome ſimilitude; The Prophet anſwereth him, or rather the holy Ghoſt by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa</hi> 40. 18. To whom will ye liken God? or what likeneſs will ye compare unto him? or, we may in alluſion thereunto ſay, Who ſhall compare the eſſence of the Creator, to the eſſence of the creature; and who ſhall liken the divine perſons, with the humane? or the humane unto the divine? I ſhall onely, to clear out what hath been ſaid of the holy Ghoſts perſonality, adde this argument.</p>
                     <p>If thoſe actions are properly attributed to the holy Ghoſt which are proper to a perſon, then he is a perſon.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe actions are properly attributed to the holy Ghoſt which are proper to a perſon; therefore he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I ſhall mention but ſome (of many) actions properly attributed to the holy Ghoſt; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. all theſe worketh that one and ſelf ſame Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will. Here the Spirit is deſcribed, not as a motion or operation, but as a perſon properly acting, willing, working. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. he is ſaid to conſtitute elders or make overſeers over the Church, the flock of God; <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 12. to teach, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8. to convince, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2. to call, and <hi>ver.</hi> 4. to ſend forth <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul, Act.</hi> 2. 4. to give utterance: and that very action which <hi>R. F.</hi> granteth to the Spirit, of <hi>dwelling in the Saints,</hi> is ſo far from diſproving him to be a perſon (for which end he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth it) as it clearly proves him to be one. For how doth he dwell in the Saints? not perſonally, yet properly (more then by way of operation) as a owner, or inhabitant in his houſe; as a God, and as a Lord in his Temple: this perſon dwels in the Saints, though not perſonally, yet myſtically and in a true ſpiritual way of inhabitation. 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 16. Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> And do we-know that, and ſhall we not know, and acknowledge him a perſon, and a perſon of note and eminency? <hi>He is not a Perſon,</hi> ſaith <hi>R. F. but he dwelleth in perſons.</hi> If that be a reaſon why the holy Ghoſt is no perſon, the Father (with this corrupt reaſon) muſt be no perſon, nor the Son any (who yet have the very

He came] i. e.</hi> by Types, Figures, Sacrifices, Prophets, Scriptures, [<hi>unto his own</hi>] the Jews of his own nation, and account is given of them two ways; ſome diſowned him, were ſtrangers to him, [<hi>and his own;</hi>] the generality of the Jewiſh nation in all Ages before he came in the fleſh, as ſince [<hi>received him not</hi>] for God, or as the Son of God: (Thus far the world before Chriſt, will be convinced another day of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, oſcitancy, and neglect of Chriſts God-head; much more the Jews, not underſtanding, nor owning him to be their Creator, who gave them their natural being, life and light; and moſt of all, they who have had the Goſpel, and yet deny him to be God.) [<hi>But</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>as many</hi>] of the Jews firſt, and that before his coming in the fleſh, as well as ſince, [<hi>as received him, or believed on his Name] i. e.</hi> his Perſon, Worth, and Dignity, as the natural Son of God, equal with God, and the very God, [<hi>to them he gave power,</hi>] right, priviledge, and dignity [<hi>to become the</hi> (adopted) <hi>ſons of God.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>A queſtion yet might be put, How came ſome to know, receive, believe on Chriſt, and become the ſons of God, others not, when every man had a light? <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>The anſwer is both general and ſpecial, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take it thus, [<hi>Who were born</hi>] they were born belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and they were born the children of God, as well as adopted to be ſo; but how?</p>
                     <p n="1">In ſpecial the anſwer is 1. Negatively, and that three ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. [<hi>Not of blood</hi>] they became not believers and the ſons of God, by the firſt birth, which is of the blood and ſeed of earthly parents, no though the blood, parentage, and deſcent be never ſo noble and royal.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. [<hi>Nor of the will of the fleſh</hi>] that is, Their new ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth is not an extract or product of corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the will of the fleſh is rebellion, and the wiſdom of the fleſh, enmity againſt God and grace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. [<hi>Nor of the will of man] i. e.</hi> Not of the power of that natural faculty, the Will, nor of mans choice or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115729:48"/> who ſhould believe, and be Gods children, who not; and therefore, not from that free arbitrament and umpirage of mans Reaſon and Will together, nor from the <hi>light which every man hath,</hi> which is a low common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to this, and is no drop of this immortal ſeed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Affirmatively, [<hi>But of God</hi>] his own will, power, and good pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>All this time the Evangeliſt having proved Chriſts Deity againſt <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus,</hi> and their followers, who denied it; then proceeds he <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. to aſſert and prove his Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet hath one paſſage more of his Deity in the ſame Verſe: [<hi>And the word,</hi> ſaith <hi>John, was made fleſh.</hi>] He that was God in the ſecond perſon, aſſumed the truth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the humane nature into the Unity of his perſon, and [<hi>dwelt among us</hi>] in that tabernacle of his fleſh, and [<hi>we</hi>] (who received of his fulneſs, and grace for grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.) [<hi>beheld</hi>] through the lanthorn, as it were, of his Humanity [<hi>his glory, the glory as of the onely begotten of the Father;</hi>] the glory of the fulneſs of the God-head dwelling in him bodily, as <hi>Col. 2. 9. i. e.</hi> really, perſonally, and to viſible manifeſtation. This is a light indeed, which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples had, that leads to the Father; the light of Chriſt as Mediator, which now he ſpeaks of: For Chriſt, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is a Mediator in both Natures; and though he that is Mediator, giveth the light that every man hath, yet he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives that which every man hath, as Mediator; nor is the light which every man hath, light about his Mediation. <hi>R. F.</hi> would have it ſo, and ſo would others; but their Wills, as their Judgements, are as over-thwarting to the the will of God, and judgement of the Scriptures, as <hi>R. F.</hi> is in his Expoſition of other Scriptures (with <hi>John</hi> 1. 9.) touching the <hi>Light in every man,</hi> as will further appear in the following Section.</p>

                     <p>I Charged them here with magnifying the <hi>Light within them</hi> (and which every man hath, which is no more then the light of natural Conſcience, or that which ſome men
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115729:48"/> have under the Goſpel, but a common enlightning) above the light of Scripture; and equal with the choiceſt light [for kinde] that Chriſt or his Spirit gives unto the Saints. <hi>R. F.</hi>

                     <p>Again, he throws dirt in my face, [<hi>Thou alſo contradicts thy ſelf, and lies againſt Chriſt the true Light, calling him natural and common; and lies of ſuch as witneſs Chriſt, and the Light of his Spirit, and according to the declaration of the Scriptures.</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Rep</hi> 1. As to any ſelf-contradiction of mine, he diſcovers none, nor will it be found by any ſober and judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and of things that are not, and that do not appear, there is the ſame reaſon and bottom.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for my lye againſt Chriſt the <hi>true light,</hi> calling <hi>him</hi> natural and common, I am confident every faithful unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced perſon, will turn it over to <hi>R. F.</hi> and lay it at his door. For I onely called the light which every man hath, <hi>natural;</hi> and the light which ſome men have under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>but common;</hi> I called not <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>true light</hi> ſo: For although Chriſt, as God, gives natural light to all, and common enlightning to ſome men, (of which, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. ſome men have it who never had ſpecial ſanctified light) yet he is not to be called or accounted as low, as ſome of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are. But we honor, adore, and magnifie him, as God,<note place="margin">Chriſt and the Spirit above his gifts</note> who worketh but ſuch common works, though we put them not into his own place, nor lift up that natural or common light into the room of a Savior.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He that witneſſeth not Chriſt and the light of the Spirit (of which witneſſing he boaſteth) above the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light which is given to every man, and above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon light (though ſupernatural) which is given to ſome men, doth not witneſs Chriſt and the light of the Spirit home and cloſe according to the Scriptures. Chriſt, as Chriſt, the Lords anointed, anointed above his fellows, is above all his gifts which he beſtoweth on men, not onely
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115729:49"/> as he is God, <hi>viz.</hi> natural and common gifts; but as he is Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> peculiar and ſaving gifts: And the light of the Spirit, is either that which he is eſſentially with the Father and Son, which is above all created and conferred light, as high as God is above the creature; or that which he gives: now the light which the Spirit giveth, he giveth in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or in a ſaving way. There are but natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inſtincts, and lightnings of the Spirit; and there are ſpecial; peculiar, and ſanctifying. The God-head and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Spirit, is more above all theſe his gifts, then the heavens are above the earth. This is to witneſs Chriſt and the Spirit according to the Scriptures. What light <hi>R. F.</hi> hath about the Spirit, the Reader may diſcern by what paſt before in the ſeventh Section.</p>
                     <p>But to make good my Charge at the entrance of this, I noted from <hi>G. Fox,</hi> that ſpeaking of <hi>every mans light,</hi> he tells all that would know the way, <hi>This is the true teacher; and the Light within is life, the Light in Scripture is death.</hi> Contrary as I ſaid to <hi>Epheſ. 5. 8. Jer. 10. 14. &amp;c.</hi> For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Grant there is ſome truth in every mans light, or as<note place="margin">Vniverſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. it could not be impriſoned, yet it is not the teacher of ſaving truths. That which is but every mans light, teacheth the true way to life, by a mans own works; but it teacheth nothing of the way, truth, and life, that is, of Jeſus Chriſt dying for ſinners. The Epheſians and all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were left in the dark for all that natural teaching, and the Jews and every man left in a brutiſh caſe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their natural wiſdom; I ſay brutiſh, with that Scripture in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> becauſe the brute beaſts are not more below the natural reaſon of man, then the natural minde and reaſon of every man is below the light of the new creature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Grant again, (as I did in my former piece) that the light of the Scripture-law, and bare Commandment, is death, ſentencing the tranſgreſſors of it to death, yet there is another kinde of light mentioned, revealed) promiſed, and ſhining forth in the Scripture, called the light of the glorious Goſpel, and Salvation-light; which if it be always <hi>death</hi> to <hi>G.

                     <p>All that <hi>R. F.</hi> in defence of <hi>George Fox</hi> returns me, is, [<hi>Where thou art offended at him for ſaying the Light of Chriſt is life, it is but to manifeſt thy envy againſt the truth, and thy contradictions to the Scriptures; for the Scripture ſaith, Chriſt is the light,</hi> John 1. 9. <hi>And he is the life,</hi> John 14. <hi>And ſuch as follow him the true light, are led out of darkneſs, (error and deceit) into the light of life,</hi> John 8. 12.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. I was offended at <hi>G. F.</hi> and am now at <hi>R. F.</hi> for defending the offence, which is this, <hi>That the light within</hi> (every man) is ſaid to be life, in oppoſition to the light in the Scriptures, which he calls <hi>death;</hi> whereas there is no light to bring men to life and glory, but it is taught in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The light given to all men, <hi>John</hi> 1. 4, and 9. (as I ſaid above) is indeed the preſent life of rational creatures, and among men, but what is that to the life of communion with God in grace and glory?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The light of life, or Salvation by Chriſt a Mediator, to lead ſuch as (by grace) follow him, out of darkneſs, is not known by the remnants of the old creation-light, much leſs can that old creation-light lead into the redeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of life, although men follow it never ſo cloſe and hard at the heels.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To equal every mans light (as if it were for kinde the ſame) with the choiceſt light of the Saints, is to contradict the Scriptures.</p>

                        <hi>every man, and teaching every man.</hi> Here he would level the light of the Saints with every mans light, and with Chriſts perſon alſo: Whereas,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the Apoſtle ſaith, He warneth every man, he doth not ſpeak of every man that cometh into the world; for never did every man live in one Age, nor did <hi>Paul</hi> meet with half the men of the world in that Age.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The phraſe [<hi>every man</hi>] in that place muſt be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the 26 and 27 <hi>verſes,</hi> [every <hi>ſuch</hi> man] as is a Saint (in one place and another where he came) not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, (except in Juſtification) that he may be preſented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Chriſt Jeſus in holineſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſts perſon, with and by his Spirit, dwelleth in every Saint, with a light that never was given to every man that cometh into the world, nor ever will be given.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the world unconverted, as well as to the Saints, yet it was to bring them (who were of Gods election) among the Saints, that they might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that myſterious light which they knew nothing of before. But <hi>R. F.</hi> thinks if the Scripture make mention of [every man] it muſt needs include every man, that is, was, or will be in the world; therefore he addeth, (in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Pamphlet) <hi>The Apoſtle ſaith to the</hi> Romans, <hi>That as well as to them, God hath given to every man a meaſure of grace,</hi> Rom. 12. 3. <hi>And none ſhall be condemned for that</hi>

                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:115729:50"/>1. By [every man] is not meant every man that cometh into the world, but that cometh into the Church, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Saints; or, whether in or out of the Church yet, maketh profeſſion of Faith, and hath received ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural gifts in meaſure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>meaſure of faith</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, not a meaſure of grace.

                     <p>Secondly, whereas he adds [<hi>Thou may well lye of us that lyes of the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, <hi>and wreſts not our words onely, but his alſo</hi>] Let any indifferent perſon judge how he makes this out; I had ſhewed how contrary they are (who would ſet up the teaching by the creatures againſt the Scriptures) to <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerting, <q rend="margQuotes">"1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. that, when by the wiſdom of<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21. opened and</note> this world (in all the ſtudy of the creatures) men knew not God (to life and ſalvation) it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching (a Text, a Doctrine, a Reaſon, a Uſe out of the word) to ſave them that believe.</q> 
                        <hi>R. F.</hi> excepteth two ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>There is not any ſuch words of</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>as Text,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">vindicated.</note> 
                        <hi>Doctrine, Reaſon, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, to ſave them that believe, and here thou haſt lyed of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. The words (a Text, a Doctrine, a Reaſon, a Uſe) were in a Parentheſis, as a part of the Paraphraſe, with what went before. By the fooliſhneſs of preaching <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth the matter he preached, Chriſt crucified according to Scripture Text, Doctrine, Reaſon, and Uſe, which very ſubject preached of, the Greeks and Gentiles counted fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, and being preached according to Scripture Text, &amp;c. <hi>R. F.</hi> accounteth a lye. That <hi>Paul</hi> preached according to Scripture-Text (which laid together one place compared with another hath Doctine, Reaſon, and Uſe in it) let who pleaſe conſult <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 22, 23. and <hi>chap.</hi> 28. 23. and it will be abundantly evident.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That God hath converted millions, and ſaved them, by this way of preaching, <hi>R. F.</hi> will know one day, whether he be one of the number, or not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I uſed that paraphraſe the rather, becauſe preaching of Chriſt from a Scripture-Text, &amp;c. is ſo much deſpiſed by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115729:55"/> men of <hi>R. F.</hi> his profeſſion, and by himſelf after his maner jeered at, <note n="*" place="margin">See Part 2. Sect. 27.</note> (as I afterwards noted in my book, <hi>pag.</hi> 26) But let him and the reſt know, that heaven and earth ſhall fail, before one Text, Doctrine, Reaſon, Uſe or Iota of any of theſe in Scripture ſhall fall to the ground, for want of truth, or accompliſhment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he excepteth againſt my calling the Letter <hi>the Word,</hi> as if I would <hi>make the Letter a Savior.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. This exception ariſeth from the paſſage before mentioned [<hi>a Text &amp;c. out of the word</hi>] meaning <hi>out of the Scripture,</hi> which how it is the <hi>Word,</hi> and that it is ſo called by the holy Ghoſt, and his Pen-men of the Scripture, hath been already cleared.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt, the Author of ſalvation to them that obey him ſpeaking in the Scripture, ſaveth by the Scripture, read, ſoundly interpreted, rightly divided, faithfully applyed. If <hi>R. F.</hi> ſaith the contrary, as he doth, [<hi>Chriſt the alone Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, or perfect Savior, being able to ſave all that come unto God by him (not by the Scripture) but by him</hi>] he dares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Lord Jeſus himſelf, who directeth his very enemies to the Scriptures <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. to finde eternal life by him, as he is in, and by the Scriptures diſcovered.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the Scripture declares of Chriſt, as <hi>R. F.</hi> grants, either Chriſt maketh that declaration of him ſaving to ſome, or not: If not, it doth not declare him to be an able Savior; if yea, then he ſaveth by that declaration, or by the Scripture. One word more we muſt animadvert <note n="*" place="margin">Page 9.</note> from <hi>R. F.</hi> ere we cloſe this Section. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, 1 John 5. 12. (if he have not the Letter) but he that hath not the Son hath not life (though he may have all the Letter.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Would not <hi>R. F.</hi> or his friends think it raſh and<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 12. vindicated.</note> broad language, if I ſhould ſalute him with [<hi>thou lyeſt</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>John</hi> hath no ſuch words as [<hi>if he have not the Letter</hi>] nor [<hi>though he may have all the Letter</hi>] and yet this kinde of uſage I had even now from <hi>him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is no part of the Apoſtles meaning to exclude the Scripture from being a means to eſpouſe Chriſt and a Chriſtian together. <hi>Having</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> relates to the <hi>Brides having</hi> the <hi>Bridegroom.</hi> It becomes not the Bride to reject
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115729:56"/> the Letter of her Bridegroom, and the word of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by which ſhe is married to him, which is the word of Scripture preached, opened and applyed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If they that have all the Letter in form, may yet have none of Chriſt in power, and therefore not life; how ſhall they be thought to have Chriſt in life and power, who <hi>will</hi> have none of the Letter as they ought to have, and hold it, <hi>viz.</hi> a glorious means of their knowledge of Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of their ſalvation by him?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>R. F.</hi> ſaith nothing in defence hereof, nor in oppoſition to what I diſcovered of its Scripture-contradiction from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. It is written, Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him; yet by what he hath elſewhere, we may not conclude his ſilence (as to this Section) to be an Argument either of his conſent or diſſent; but I ſhall evidence my charge againſt <hi>G. F.</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of God, <hi>gave forth the Scriptures,</hi> by his Spirit inſpiring them that wrote as he moved and acted them, is a moſt undeniable Truth: For Chriſt is the great Light giver; he gives common Creation-light, and he gives ſpecial Scripture-light, and all that is truly called Light-given; and he is above all that he giveth: But when men ſpeak of the light given to every man (as <hi>G. F.</hi> doth) and then attribute as much to it, as to the perſon of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Light [in every man] gave forth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and will open the Scriptures to us;</hi> this is palpable darkneſs, and contradiction to the Scripture I quoted:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9. opened.</note> for as mans eye, or minde (as he is a rational creature, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115729:56"/> but ſo) never reach'd the things of God, which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in a way of ſalvation for his own; ſo the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light about matters of Salvation (of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>never entred,</hi> never ſhined <hi>into mans heart;</hi> take him, with all the light given him, as a man, before the fall, or ſince at his coming into the world. Goſpel and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-matters never entred into <hi>Adams</hi> heart before the fall, and ſince, there is not any of his poſterity that (by the light he bringeth with him into the world) can tell what he ſhould do, what way or courſe he ſhould take to be ſaved, no more then his firſt parents, when they hid themſelves amongſt the trees of the garden. And that light which cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Salvation, cannot open the Scriptures to us. Nothing gives that which it hath not. Nothing can act beyond the ſphere of its activity.</p>
                     <p>As for what <hi>G. F.</hi> addeth, [<hi>And 'tis a more ſure word of prophecy</hi>] ſpeaking of every mans light; we will believe him as much as if he told an old wives fable; if either he would have it to be more ſure then the Scriptures, or then Goſpel-Sermons preached out of, and according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Heretofore it became a proverb, <hi>As true as the Goſpel,</hi> there being infallible certainty in the Scripture-Goſpel; but now there is a Light diſcovered in every man that will antiquate that Goſpel, and put the proverb out of date. There is ſomething in the heart of every man (ſay<note place="margin">No Goſpel, in light of nature.</note> they) and <hi>that</hi> a word of prophecy, or a declaration of Gods minde, for ſalvation too, (or elſe 'tis nothing) more ſure then all the Goſpel throughout the Scripture; and yet (ſay I) no part of the Goſpel at all: For no man ſhall be able to ſpell out one Goſpel-ſyllable, or letter in it, or by it, <hi>viz.</hi> in all that is written in <hi>every mans</hi> heart, or by all that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there from their coming into the world. And yet it muſt be with <hi>G. F. the Grace that appeared unto all men.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Titus 2 11. vindicated.</note> Such an expreſſion indeed hath the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the free favor of God in Chriſt, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and original cauſe of Salvation, now ſhining to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the Goſpel, and ſaving effectually ſome of all ſorts of men in the world; But as <hi>Paul</hi> never called every mans light; the Grace of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt (although that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115729:57"/> Light be a free gift) ſo never was it every mans light or gift, nor will be, to underſtand what is the Scripture-grace of God, and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; But the Doctrine of it is turned into wantonneſs, when it is laid waſte and common with the univerſal light of every individual reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which 1. is but a part, a ſpark of that which <hi>Adam</hi> had before the fall: 2. Gives not a creviſe of light about Chriſt crucified: 3 Is but a Legal-light and effect of the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the old-ſtony heart of every man.</p>

                     <p>Whereas 1.

                     <p>From his Book Entituled (how truly let the Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights be judge) <hi>Light riſen out of darkneſs,</hi> I had noted what he ſaith, <hi>The light is pure, ſtanding out of all corruption,</hi> meaning this light of every man, which, where it is (and it is in every man) it reneweth the judgement, and <hi>where the judgement is renewed, there is no corruption in that judgement;</hi> (as was told me by one of them in <hi>Scotland</hi>) But this beam of God-head-light in every man, is no part of the new creature, or of ſuch a renewed minde as the Apoſtle calls for, <hi>Rom. 12. 2.

And although that which is a renewed principle in ſome is pure, (ſo far as it is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) yet the faculty where it is [<hi>the minde</hi>] hath darkneſs, corruption and pollution in it, as well as light and purity, as is clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>R. F.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">page 10. line 12.</note> tells me <hi>I have ſlandered him for ſaying, The Light is pure, ſtanding out of corruption, but my ſlander hath no weight, nor doth him no harm.</hi>

If he would be underſtood to ſpeak of Gods Eſſence onely, we agree in the light and underſtanding of the Text, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. But if he would have it partly meant of God, and partly of the Light either innate, or regenerate in the creature, then he confounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created and created Light, and ſhews his own woful darkneſs.</p>

The words of <hi>James Nayler</hi> are theſe more at large: <hi>Thou goeſt about to make people believe, that the light of Chriſt, which is given to every one that comes into the world, is a natural or fallen light; but if thou didſt know, own, and obey it, it would lead thee out of the fall.</hi> The very words I cited, and in the very ſenſe of the writer; for <hi>J.

From the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. (which I briefly pointed at, as contradicted by <hi>J. N.</hi> and others of this opinion) <hi>I had not known luſt, except the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115729:61"/> law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> I hinted an Argument, which I ſhall now give forth in form;
<list type="syllogism">
                           <item>That which will not ſo much as diſcover the fall, will not (though own'd and obeyed) lead out of the fall:</item>
                           <item>But the light given to every man, will not ſo much as diſcover the fall:</item>
                           <item>Therefore, it will not (though own'd and obeyed) lead out of the fall.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt propoſition I thus confirm, There is no delivery without a diſcovery. The other thus, <hi>Pauls</hi> light did not diſcover the fall; nor other mens light, which they have from their coming into the world, did never, will never ſo much as diſcover the fall. <hi>In the fall,</hi> will be found <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, all mens ſinning in him, their being born in the guilt of that ſin, in the want of Gods image, and in the roots of all actual ſin. What a ſtranger was <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Phariſaiſm, to all theſe Diſcoveries? who knew not the leaſt luſting of the heart to be ſin, till he was enlightned by the Spirit into the commandment of the written Law, which ſaith, Thou ſhalt not luſt: the ſame ignorance is in every man (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their in-bred light) concerning in-bred luſt, and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corruption, till by the light of the ſame commandment, the Spirit of conviction brings it home to his heart.</p>
                     <p>With what an impudent evaſion doth <hi>R. F.</hi> entertain his Reader? by telling him that <hi>J. Nayler witneſſeth with Chriſt who is the true light, and ſuch as obey the light and follow Chriſt, they are led thereby out of the fall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep. 1. James Nayler</hi> ſaith not, ſuch as obey Chriſt, but <hi>ſuch as obey it;</hi> he ſpeaks of the Light-given, and its power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>R. F.</hi> confounds the Light-given and the Light-giver (as often elſwhere) together, and yet attributes the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the fall to it, [the Light-given] rather then to Chriſt the Light-giver.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Should he expreſs himſelf more plainly, and ſay, Chriſt <hi>thereby,</hi> that is, by the Light given to every man, as <hi>it</hi> is obeyed, and <hi>himſelf</hi> is followed, doth lead out of the fall; yet would he ſpeak ſhort of the truth, and contrary to Scripture; For,</p>

                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:115729:61"/>1. The Scripture ſpeaks not of ſuch a way whereby Chriſt led any man out of the Fall, before the Scriptures were given, but onely of the way of offering Typical Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and by the promiſe of Chriſt-mediator.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſame way he hath chalked out in and by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſince they were given, all along the Old Teſtament; and when Chriſts ſacrifice, typed out and promiſed, was once exhibited by his own blood, He that was the <hi>way</hi> yeſterday, is the ſame to day, and for ever, while the world ſtandeth, to lead men out of the fall, and to raiſe them up to communion with the Father.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Although <hi>R. F.</hi> addes [<hi>they were ſaved by him, and that is not contrary to Scripture</hi>] it will not ſave his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from error, nor his writing from contradiction, if he ſaith or thinketh that Chriſt ever ſaved any man by the meer light, which (as God) he giveth to every man. No man ever was, or will be ſaved by his beſt obedience yielded to the light which every man comes with into the world. Every man, and onely ſuch, as through grace have obeyed, and ſhall follow Chriſt according as he is revealed in the Scripture, is and ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                     <p>What a loud calumny is that which <hi>R. F.</hi> hath caſt upon me at the foot of his tenth <hi>Page? [Thou contradicts, and ſo ſins againſt Scripture, and againſt Chriſt that calls him a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> I have no ſuch words, had no ſuch meaning, nor can it be pickt out of what I have any where ſpoken. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt as he is God (as every where I expreſs or intend it) giveth to every man that which is but natural light, yet is not he therefore a <hi>natural light:</hi> For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He and his works are not the ſame. He who is the divine, ſpiritual, ſupernatural Being, giveth to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture its proper nature and being, and is incomprehenſibly above them: He is indeed his own nature, and his own moſt ſimple eſſence and being, preſent with all beings in created nature, and yet not confounded or mixed with created na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural beings or lights, irrational or rational.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Albeit, as the God of created-nature, he giveth that nature, life, and light of Reaſon to all men; yet as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115729:62"/> he giveth a diſtinct, ſpiritual, excelling light, to lead men out of the fall; partly from the whole written Law,<note place="margin">How Chriſt leads men out of the fall.</note> and the diſcovery of its ſpiritualneſs, reaching the motions of the heart to ſhew men the fall, which prepares for a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; partly from the Goſpel, which ſhews himſelf the onely effectual way whereby men may come out of their lapſed condition, as they are taught and drawn of the Father to believe in him, who hath ſatisfied and merited for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of ſinners their deliverance; and who applies that merited deliverance by remiſſion of ſins, and by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; and by both, a tranſlation out of the power of darkneſs (which all men with their beſt natural light are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) into his own kingdom of ſaving light and life.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed: In this Section I had hinted another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the power of <hi>natural light,</hi> given to every man to lead him out of the fall, by way of queſtion; <hi>R.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115729:63"/> &amp;c. in him. But hath God promiſed to give Chriſt for a Mediator to every one that well uſeth the reliques of created light? Or hath he promiſed to admit all or any into a covenant of Grace, who do their beſt to get life by a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works? Nay, rather he hath threatned the contrary, as I hinted in my former piece, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. As many as are of the works of the law, that is, will be doing for life, and depending upon their obedience to the law (written in the book of Scripture, which is more, or in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans heart, which is leſs) are under the curſe; and if under the curſe, they are (as I ſaid) ſure enough under the fall. <hi>R. F.</hi> quoteth other Scriptures, as <hi>Iſaiah 49. 6. Iſaiah</hi> 60. 19, 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 22, 23. I ſuppoſe he intended, <hi>Ver.</hi> 32. but let him or any man make the beſt, or the moſt rather, he can of them, he ſhall never be able to extract ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as I called for, of that tendency as he would have it, out of them all. That which I called for, was a promiſe of ſpiritual ſaving light and grace, annexed, or adjoyned to the uſe of natural light and common gifts; ſpiritual, and ſaving light and grace, is light of a higher ſphere, and a gift of another kinde, <hi>i. e.</hi> which differeth not in degree onely, but in kinde, from every mans natural light, as much as the work of Redemption, from the work of Creation. Nor doth it follow, becauſe Chriſt is promiſed for a ſaving light to the Gentiles, that therefore he is promiſed to them upon ſuch an account, if they uſe inferior light as they ought; or, that becauſe Chriſts grace is promiſed to the uſe of his grace, therefore his grace is promiſed to the uſe or actings of nature: Or that becauſe <hi>this light</hi> (as R. F) <hi>hath grace,</hi> or a promiſe of grace, <hi>annexed,</hi> therefore <hi>every light</hi> hath grace, or a promiſe of grace attending it. I know there are thoſe, who are Lights of a greater magnitude then <hi>R.

But ſometimes they ſay, Stand ſtill in the Light, and it ſhall lead thee out of the fall; ſometimes there are promiſes of ſaving Light, or elſe a man might continue in the fall and under the curſe: either that alone muſt ſave, or that and Chriſt together, by their Doctrine; whereas Chriſt alone (above the help of that light which every man hath) leads out of the fall, unto the Father, and unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thoſe that the Father hath given to him, to be a Leader, Commander, and Savior unto.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The Condition and foundation of the one is mans perſonal obedience; of the other, Chriſts obedience and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115729:64"/> ſatisfaction thereby to the juſtice of God, on others behalf, for whom he freely becomes a ſurety: Hence the Covenant of Grace is called a Teſtament, as well as a Covenant, not ſo, the covenant of Works.</p>

This were eaſie to demonſtrate from Scripture, but that I ſtudy rather to contract then enlarge.</p>

                        <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had Goſpel preached to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Chriſt, that eminent Seed of the woman, which ſhould break the Serpents head, <hi>i. e.</hi> by ſufferings, and ſatisfaction to God, ſhould overcome all the power of his accuſations of the elect, the redeemed ſeed, before God. <hi>Abraham</hi> had the Goſpel preached to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. concerning juſtification by free Grace. The promiſe of Chriſts coming out of his loins contained in it the promiſe of life and ſalvation: ſo did the promiſe of Gods being a God of him, and of his ſeed. God holds up the ſame covenant from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> for he renews it to <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 26. 4. And when he puts a meſſage into <hi>Moſes</hi> mouth, he calls himſelf the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac, Exod.</hi> 3. 6. 16. which ſhews he dealt with <hi>Jacob</hi> after the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ſo would he carry it on with his poſterity then in <hi>Egypt.</hi> In <hi>Moſes</hi> time it holds in force when the Law is given, as the Apoſtle clears it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16, 17.

That which <hi>Paul</hi> preached was promiſed before by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures, and as any believed, they were partakers of the ſaving benefit of this gracious covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. The righteouſneſs of God, or his<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 21. opened.</note> righteous way of ſaving ſinners by Chriſt (without our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal obedience to the Law and without the Laws diſcovery, as it is a covenant of Works) is now manifeſted by the preachers of the New Teſtament, that before was witneſſed by the doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, under the old adminiſtration. The Apoſtles, all of them preached for ſubſtance, what was in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 23. that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, &amp;c. and be a light and ſalvation to the ends of the earth. <hi>Act. 13. 47. Peter</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 11. this was that he taught and believed, that we through the grace of the Lord Jeſus ſhall be ſaved, as they;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115729:65"/> as who? as the believers of the Old Teſtament. It was the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that ſaved, then and now; and if any mixed Goſpel be taught, not that which was of pure grace from the beginning, the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. would have the doctrine and the Doctor accurſed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. The maner of diſpenſation of this Goſpel-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant<note place="margin">2 In the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note> was different from that it is ſince Chriſts death.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It was adminiſtred after a legal and ſervile way, urged with legal conditions of doing, and darkly vailed over with Types and Ceremonies. They heard of doing more then believing, and the adminiſtration gendred, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. unto bondage: every carnal heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving there was nothing miniſtred of righteouſneſs or ſtrength at all from another: and being called and counted nothing but Law, hence it is that the ſpirit of bondage is ſaid more commonly to ſute that Old adminiſtration: The Church, in this time, was conſidered as an Heir, in its mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. As an Heir it was free, but as an Infant, or in its mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it was but as a ſervant, under Tutors and Governors, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1. As an Heir, true believers had then the Spirit of Adoption, and Liberty; As a Childe, it had the ſpirit of fear and ſervitude. And as it was but a dark and ſervile admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, comparatively to what it is; So,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There was but a ſcanty proportion of graces and gifts (as to the generality even of true believers) they had little illumination, and a ſmall meaſure of ſanctification (I ſpeak of the greater number of the Saints) to what is, and will be given ſince Chriſts Aſcenſion, from the greateſt to the leaſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The diſpenſation of Grace, and its covenant was but to a few families for a time; and afterwards but to one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſpringing out of thoſe families; under the new admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration the Covenant is made with all ſorts of families, and with ſome of every nation. In ſtead of one there have been, and are many Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. and 15. 14. Every where God hath had, and will have a people taken out from among the Gentiles, or nations, a ſelect company, for his Name.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The ſeals, and witneſſes of the Teſtament are altered
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115729:66"/> from Old to New; and although the writings of the old copy remain, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Books of the Old Teſtament, becauſe the ſubſtance of the covenant is there to be read, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the ſhadows, yet there are new writings added, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Books of the New Teſtament, for clearer underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and more aſſurance of faith, when both are compared together. The reaſon of the whole change of the old ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration<note place="margin">The reaſon of the change of old into new adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to the new, in the particulars named, was faultineſs or imperfection. It is the wiſdom of God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ways leſs perfect, to that which is more perfect. <hi>Heb. 8. 7. If that firſt Covenant</hi> or <hi>Teſtament,</hi> that is, the firſt adminiſtration of the covenant of Grace, <hi>had been fault leſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb 8 7. opened.</note> 
                        <hi>then ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond.</hi> How was it faulty?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In that it made nothing perfect, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. 19. All in that old way, eſpecially the Sacrifices, being typical and ſhadowy, they of themſelves could not take away ſins; therefore Chriſt, whoſe body was fitted for a ſacrifice, he comes and puts by the ſhadows and types, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. He takes away the firſt adminiſtration, that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond; the perfection of his own ſacrifice, and all that attends it in the new adminiſtration. His blood ſtancheth all other blood, ſtays the further ſhedding of the blood of Bulls and Goats; and he coming by Blood, and not by Water onely, hath left to his Church a commemoration and obſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both, in his new Inſtitutions of Baptiſm, and his Supper.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In that people could not (as it was diſpenſed after the maner of a covenant of Works, though not ſo in it ſelf) poſſibly ſee how to ſtand or continue in it. They ſtumbled at the Ceremonies, and ſtuck in the Letter of the Law, and could not ſee unto the end of that which is now aboliſhed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. But whence was the fault? God was not to be blamed, nor the ſubſtance of his Covenant; but he lays the blame upon them, who were willing to ſtand under ſuch an adminiſtration, and would not look to the kernel, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſubſtance of it, which was Chriſt. But as it was the Jews infidelity which turned (as to them) that which was a covenant of Grace into a covenant of Works, ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115729:66"/> in the rinde and bark of the Ceremony, and which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and ſhut them out from the Grace of the covenant; ſo do many thouſands under the new adminiſtration (the greater is their ſin) inſiſt upon terms of doing and obeying the Light within them; and God lets them go on, and work their heart out, if they will, for life; let them get it, win it, and wear it; although he tells them it is impoſſible; for if the Jews in all the Ceremonies of old ſhould have lookt to Chriſt in them, and beyond them; the Gentiles ſhould upon the firſt hearing of Chriſt, believe on him, and begin and end all their duties, with the uſe of all New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Inſtitutions in him, or they will loſe all their labor, as did the Jews.</p>

There was a common favor in it, that God ſhould vouchſafe to enter into covenant with his Creature upon any terms; but as there needed no mercy before it was broken, ſo when it is broken, there is judgement for the ſinner without mercy.

Chriſt of neceſſity therefore muſt die to ratifie the <hi>Will.</hi> A covenant of Works exacteth death if it be tranſgreſſed; but it is the death and blood of the ſinner. Under the Levitical Law the tranſgreſſors did not die, but the beaſt died for the tranſgreſſor; which plainly ſhewed it to be a covenant of Grace and gracious Teſtament, wherein the death of Chriſt is accepted, not the ſinners, as that by which, all the Legacies of the <hi>Will,</hi> and good things of the Covenant, are both purchaſed and aſſured.</p>

If the covenant of works was not made with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, (ſeeing he was a publique perſon) God could not in juſtice require ſatisfaction of his poſterity under the fall, and in miſery: But he requireth juſt ſatisfaction of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity under the fall, and in miſery. The juſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that is due to him, is not onely the ſuffering of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite puniſhment, for the offence againſt him, who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; but that perfect obedience, due to him from creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtrength to have performed in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, <hi>viz.</hi> ſtrength to have kept in that perfect ſtate, and to obey any command, that God, as a Creator, might, in a juſt way, give unto his creature.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115729:70"/> God in a way of active obedience, endeavoring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with their offended Creator, and to pay a part for the whole; and while they attempt impoſſibilities, they are found debtors to the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. Now, albeit God makes not, nay, renews not the covenant of works, no not by the death of Chriſt (as ſome would have it) with any man ſince the fall; yet keeping them under the penalties he loſeth not his right of exacting the principal debt, and he doth require it of thoſe who will be paying a part for the whole, to get life thereby: Therefore, ſuch a covenant <hi>Adam</hi> was under in innocency, as obliged him to pay the whole debt of the Moral Law in its rigor. Again, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a poor ſoul falls under the conviction, that all is due, which was given, but loſt; and doth not ſay to God, Take a part for the whole; or, have patience with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me, and I will pay thee all: but I can do nothing at all, I can ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to ſatisfaction of an infinite Juſtice, in finite time; God now <hi>ſtanding</hi> upon his <hi>Juſtice</hi> (and he muſt not let his <hi>Juſtice</hi> fall, though the creatures righteouſneſs be loſt, and the ſinner fallen ſo low) cannot give life to this poor ſinner, upon the terms of his father <hi>Adams</hi> covenant in innocency. And if Gods infinite grace, his peculiar electing-love, findes out another way of life, and the onely way of ſalvation (for the way of works, by a meer creature, as to preſervation of Gods image and communion-life is loſt, and as to ſalvation, <hi>i. e.</hi> recovery of a loſt life; that is not to be found by the invention of men or Angels) this way that God himſelf findes out, or makes diſcovery of, is in ſo juſt and righteous a way, that he lays the foundation of the covenant of grace, in the ſatisfaction of a righteous Surety, the Son of God, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who was not bound to pay the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture or principal for himſelf; nor was he bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man, or aſſume our nature, but (upon ſuppoſition of Gods decree) he voluntarily undertakes the office and work of redeeming and ſaving the Elect, (fallen with others) thereupon he ſtands obliged to aſſume their nature, (in which onely he could obey and ſuffer) and he doth aſſume it, for the perſons (the children of the Election, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.) for their ſake, and on their behalf, according to that Scripture.

                     <p n="3">3. The Spirit of God is free to move when he pleaſeth, in and upon the heart; but the Saint is obliged to duty, when, through the fleſh, he is very dull, and indiſpoſed to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

Thus the Spirit of God ſets home the law, in its vigor of ſpirituality, and rigor of exacting abſolute freedom from the leaſt ſwerving thought; and takes off a ſoul from expecting life in his own righteouſneſs; or by the beſt frame of heart that he may reach unto: and keeps him (for longer or ſhorter
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115729:74"/> time as he pleaſe) under fears of the ſecond death; and of the firſt, becauſe of the ſecond. The other in a Goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation<note place="margin">2 Preſent.</note> is experience, by the Saints, when they are through Goſpel-enlightning faith, and renovation, made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the covenant of Grace is, and what a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>command: The covenant of Grace calls for ſatisfaction at Chriſts hands, and hath it: The Goſpel command from God in the Spirit, is not ſome ſudden impulſe, or rare impreſſion upon the ſoul, which few Saints meet with, but it is every Scripture-precept which the Spirit of faith, holineſs, and liberty, works the heart to a ſweet compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance withall, according to the meaſures of grace received, amidſt the preſent and conſtant conflict with in-dwelling ſin.

The command wherewith he had no compliance before, as to the ſpirituality of it, now he conſenteth to, and delighteth in, and complains againſt that contrary frame of corrupt nature which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained (though it reigned not) and rebelled in him; but as ſin ſerved it ſelf, and its own ends; grace, and the new creature made him ſerviceable to the law of God, the Scripture-command, with which he and his new nature was reconciled; and he that cannot finde ſomething of this experience, will not finde himſelf a Saint, he that elaſheth with Scripture-commands, ſo far diſcovers himſelf to be unregenerate.

                     <p>To which I Reply, 1. The new diſtinction (and new, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not founded in Scripture) lies here, that he makes a difference between the time, <hi>whileſt</hi> the Saints ſin <hi>is working out,</hi> and <hi>their life-time:</hi> For let us conſider how long they are working out their ſin, or the Spirit for them, and in them, is that but a part of their life-time? It's a truth, we teach that groaning under a legal bondage of guilt and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115729:75"/> curſe, and fears of damnation, is but for a time, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74, 75. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. But when they are formed Saints, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the Spirit of Adoption, then they groan, and ſigh, and cry out under another bondage; not of guilt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, but of guilt deſerved, and of corruption felt, as ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing<note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</note> over the whole ſoul and body of a Saint, in part: <hi>i. e.</hi> in every faculty of the ſoul, and member of the body, there is ſome preſence of ſin with them all their days.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What Scripture is it that our aſſertion of continued groaning under the body of ſin and death, in the Saints, doth contradict? <hi>R. F.</hi> quotes <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. &amp;c. 1 <hi>john 3. Rev.</hi> 14. but never a Verſe in all theſe Chapters he hath to produce for evidence.

If ſo be would put off Errors by whole-ſale, he may do it this way.</p>
                     <p>After this, he throws dirt in the face of that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. (which I had ſaid from <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to the end was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">Rom 7. 14. to the end vindicated.</note> in the name of the regenerate) <hi>Here, though</hi> Paul <hi>did cry out of the body of death, he did not always groan and ſigh as diſſemblers [and Scots] do.</hi>

Now, was he a <hi>Saul</hi> or a <hi>Paul</hi> then? Was he <hi>Paul</hi> the Saint, or <hi>Saul</hi> the Perſecuter and Blaſphemer? Was he not then <hi>Paul</hi> the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 1. And have we not the characters he gives of himſelf, as regenerate? <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. What I hate, that do I. <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. I conſent to the Law that it is good. <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. It is not I, but ſin that dwelleth in me, (where he divides his qualities into two ſorts or kindes, as <hi>Ver.</hi> 20.) <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. To will is preſent with me. <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. He ſpeaks of his inner man, and of his delight in the Law after that renewed principle. Then he cries out, <hi>Ver.</hi> 23, 24. of what he ſees and hates Now, no man that is unregenerate can truly hate ſin, as ſin, which he did; nor hath he two contrary principles in him, all over, of grace and ſin; nor hath he a will preſent with him, to do a ſpiritual good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor hath he an inner man, the new man to delight in the ſpiritual law of God; nor doth he feel the univerſal warring law, or power of ſin in his members, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth: <hi>Paul</hi> therefore ſpeaks of himſelf as now he is at preſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; yea, he gives the account of himſelf, as ſuch; and therefore he lays forth the eſtate which is peculiar to the regenerate, and common to one and other as they are ſuch, more or leſs.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, which <hi>J. P.</hi> teacheth, <hi>While</hi> (or where) <hi>ſin is, there no purity can dwell;</hi> by which dictate, he would deſtroy the faith of all thoſe who believe no perfect freedom from the body of ſin, in this life.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, which <hi>J.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115729:78"/> the ſame water, though one in a remiſs, the other in a higher degree. God dwells as a Lord, ſin as a ſlave; purity as a prince, ſin as a tyrant, in the ſame Saint and Chriſtian. If any that is called a Saint thinks otherwiſe, he is either not as he is called; knows not himſelf, as every Saint doth in part, and in this caſe: or, if he be one really ſanctified, he is under a ſtrong deluſion, and in a moſt drowſie dream for the preſent, the Lord will awaken him in his good time.</p>

The imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt was the cauſe why their ſins were not imputed, why their perſons were accepted as perfectly righteous in Chriſt, who were but imperfectly (at the beſt) righteous in themſelves. The beſt Saint that yet liveth upon the earth, is yet a ſinner in himſelf, or his worſer part, and hath not wherewithal to cover his nakedneſs of any deſerved guilt, no not by his beſt in-dwelling, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigning holineſs, but as Chriſt gives him of his white raiment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18.

Again, as perſons were conſidered in Chriſts death, ſo they are to be conſidered when they come to be juſtified; Chriſt, dying for men and women, conſidered them not as Saints, but as ſinners.

The form, maner, and way of our Juſtification is by Gods free act of imputation, reckoning, and account of Chriſts obedience to us: the form of our Sanctification is by infuſion of holineſs, by the Spirit of holineſs, from Chriſts fulneſs into our empty hearts.</p>

The parts of our Juſtification are Gods not imputing of ſin, through his imputing of Chriſts ſufferings, and his accepting of our perſons as righteous, by his imputing of Chriſts active obedience: the parts of our Sanctification, are vivification, or the creating, quickning, and begetting new divine qualities (reſembling Gods nature) and mortification of the old ſinful diſpoſitions and ſeeds of ſin.</p>

The contrary to Sanctification, is in-bred pollution and filth of ſin, which by Chriſts power is deſtroyed, as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency; and hereafter to be removed at our death, as to the reſidence. Hence, Juſtification is Gods gracious and juſt ſentence, pronouncing us righteous, and entitling to life; as Condemnation is his charging of guilt, and vindictive puniſhment accordingly: Sanctification is Gods ſpecial grace ſhed abroad in the heart, called the firſt-fruits of the Spirit.</p>

In our Juſtification, Chriſts obedience ſtands onely upon account, and all our moſt ſanctified works and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes, ſtand by as cyphers; and are to be eſteemed as loſs and dung. Take Sanctification by it ſelf, it is of great excellency and uſe: A good work done in faith by a perſon juſtified, is better then all the glorious deeds of Phariſees and Hypocrites; but bring it, and all that all Saints can bring together, before the tribunal of Gods ſtrict Law and Juſtice, for their juſtification in that Court, and they and their works will be damned to hell, for their inherent and adherent imperfections.</p>

In our Juſtification we have that perfect righteouſneſs in Chriſt, which, as it is his, is the cauſe and merit of our ſalvation; and that gives a juſt right and title to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: In our Sanctification, we have the cognizance and badge of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, and inherit the kingdom.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115729:86"/> to juſtice. The plain Scripture is this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. Chriſt by one offering hath perfected for ever them that are<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14. cleared.</note> ſanctified. It is not ſaid in any Scripture, that Chriſt hath firſt perfectly ſanctified any perſons, and then reconciled them unto God; but the ſenſe of that, as of other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is, that Chriſt, by one offering of himſelf, hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected their juſtification, and reconciliation, whom he doth alſo ſanctifie, in the truth of it, at what inſtant he applyeth their perfect juſtification. And the plain truth, according to Scripture, is this; That, no perſon is reconciled to God,<note place="margin">How the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and yet none but the perfect perſon is reconciled to God.</note> who hath not a perfect Mediator of his reconciliation, and who is not accepted, as perfectly righteous, in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, his ſurety; and ſo tis true, none but the perfect perſon is reconciled to God: but how? not by his qualifications (at firſt an enemy, and always carrying about with him (while here) ſome wiſdom of the fleſh which is emnity againſt God) but as he had on Chriſts Croſs, his perſon repreſented, in Chriſt his head, and his ſins not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, upon the account of Chriſts righteouſneſs made, or reckoned to be his, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. 21. To clear this a little further; we muſt diſtinguiſh between the reconciling of our individual perſons, and the reconciling of our individual natures, diſpoſitions, or qualities and acts: both are a fruit of Chriſts ſatisfactory obedience and ſufferings; and <hi>they cannot</hi> (as <hi>J.

As for <hi>J. Nayler,</hi> and <hi>R. F.</hi> and ſuch as imagine, that while ſinful imperfections remain in the Saints, they, in their perſons, are not, cannot be perfectly reconciled to God; then not themſelves, nor any that adhere to their doctrine, are or can be reconciled to God, in perſon, as not in judgement, and affection, while they harbor ſuch fleſhly and legal conceits of a poor ſinners juſtification, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: and they ſhall ſee, if by this they get no eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve (Oh, that it might not be too late!) how (till they be better bottom'd) with contradictions of Scripture, they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115729:87"/> contradict, and come ſhort of true ſalvation-light, right, and poſſeſſion. For I judge it's abſolutely neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, rightly to diſcern the way of a mans juſtification before God, and reconciliation to him; which diſcerning, I perceive not in theſe mens writings, although, ſometime in diſcourſe with ſome of this Sect, I have had their confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth; yet their bad principles make them fly off again: as it fares with many a natural ignorant countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (I wiſh there be not more then a few ſuch in Cities, and populous places) who have a notion of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, but practically and experimentally cannot for their hearts, but ſtick in themſelves, and think a Bird in the hand, is better then two in the Buſh; a little of their own, within them, far beyond all Chriſts righteouſneſs without them; although we call for the witneſs within them, that will not ſuffice, they muſt have the ground-work of their juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within them, as well as the evidence: nay ſome work within ſhall be ground and evidence too; or they fly off, and will not believe till they ſee and feel; but groping, in the dark loſe themſelves in the wilderneſs of ſelf-fulneſs and ſufficiency.</p>

Here is ſin active enough, and yet its force is broken, that it cannot reign where Chriſt reigneth, but there it dwells and remains, very troubleſome to a good heart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23, 25.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23, 25 explained.</note> I ſee another Law in my members, warring againſt the Law of my minde, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of ſin, that is in my members: here is action and paſſion too; here is fighting and ſcuffling, a continual conflict.

This being the genuine ſenſe of the Apoſtle: we may grant a pious truth in ſomething <hi>R. F.</hi> ſaith, but not as properly grounded on this place. The truth is, the natural body is mortified in part to the acts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, as the habits of ſin are mortified in the ſoul;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 10. vindicated from impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> but the Apoſtle ſaith not <hi>the body is dead becauſe of ſin being deſtroyed,</hi> as <hi>R.

Sin is ſuch a troubleſome in-mate, or like ſome old inhabitant pleading preſcription, that it will not out (God ſuffering it ſo to be) till the Houſe be pulled down over its head: therefore the Apoſtles reaſon [<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſin</hi>] diſcovers them to erre who deny <hi>ſin to dwell in act where Chriſt reigneth.</hi> Sin dwelleth in the ſoul, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rooms chiefly, but it ſo lodgeth within, as it acteth and worketh in the outward room, and ſhop of the body, till body and ſoul be diſſolved, when this troubleſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is caſt out totally, finally and for ever from the Saints.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Sin may and doth act in the Saints, not <hi>they,</hi> but <hi>ſin</hi> is acting, when, as Saints, and ſo far as regenerate, they do act againſt ſin. This is not committing of ſin in <hi>Johns</hi> ſenſe (as hath been cleared before, <hi>Sect.</hi> 14.) but as <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf in the name of all the regenerate, (as hath been proved, <hi>Sect.</hi> 20.) <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 16, 17. If I do that which I would not, &amp;c. it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Although Chriſt reigns not where ſin is committed (in <hi>Johns</hi> ſenſe) yet he reigneth where that in-dwelling prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſin is mortified in truth, and in ſome degree, and where the actings of ſin are, reſiſtings of ſin are hated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and unfulfilled. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16. They that walk in the Spirit, do not <hi>fulfil</hi> the luſts of the fleſh; yet the fleſh is luſting and acting what it can againſt a Chriſtian, to make him ſtumble, while he is in a good walk.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Antichriſt reigns in none more then in filthy dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who while they preach perfection, are found in their pollutions. It is Antichriſts deſign to repreſent a ſinners Juſtification imperfect, and his Sanctification perfect, that he may glory in himſelf, and not in Chriſt. Antichriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth as much to Holineſs as theſe men (called Quakers) but out of order, and to a wrong end, as they alſo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To plead for perfect inherent Holineſs, as the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Juſtification, as <hi>J. Nayler</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. He is not under the dominion of Antichriſt, who pleads againſt his imaginary perfections, is made perfect in his Juſtification, by coming unto Chriſts ſacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 14. and in a way of Sanctification, preſſeth after more
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115729:90"/> of the power of Chriſts death and reſurrection to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thereunto.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>R. F.</hi> goes on <note n="*" place="margin">Page 15.</note> to miſ-apply Scripture, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the true ſcope and ſenſe, [<hi>He that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not</hi>]</p>

Albeit Chriſt was greater then <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet he never ſpake a word, nor that word in particular to croſs what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid from the holy Ghoſt, who is equal, and of the ſame eſſential minde and will with Chriſt. What ſaith the holy Ghoſt by <hi>Solomon?</hi> conſult the place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 9. Who can ſay I have made my heart clean? I am pure from my ſin? the ſenſe of this place is, there is none could ever ſay it; none, in any age, before, or in <hi>Solomons</hi> time: before or in Chriſts time, or ſince: none can now ſay it truly? It's a queſtion that will ſilence all the world, all the Churches; a queſtion that will hold un-anſwered till every Saints dying day, and in this laſt age till the reſurrection day.

                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:115729:98"/> meant it? this were not to reconcile ſeeming differences of Scripture among our ſelves, but to ſet Chriſt and <hi>Solomon</hi> at variance between themſelves. What then? will any help <hi>R. F.</hi> with an evaſion? <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not ſay, God gives not pure hearts, but, Who can ſay, <hi>I have made</hi> my heart clean? this will not ſerve his turn; for it followeth; <hi>and I am pure from my ſin? i. e.</hi> Who can ſay that either he hath cleanſed his own heart, or that he is pure from his ſin? which way ſoever he comes by it; and if it be true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect purity he muſt come honeſtly and purely to it, or even in that reſpect he is impure, and far from truth of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I would to God, the generation of Quakers would better attend this queſtion: Art thou pure and perfect? how cameſt thou by it? Is it not a dream? a deluſion? may not a foul and filthy heart be transformed into a fancy of pure perfection, and perfect purity, as well as a black devil be transformed into an Angel of light? <hi>Solomon</hi> how ever muſt be underſtood, as denying abſolute purity in any man: and Chriſt, when he aſſerteth Bleſſedneſs to the pure in heart, intendeth not to nouriſh any in a conceit of their preſent perfect attainments, but to encourage them who were ſincere, and have truth of holineſs ſet into their hearts, and the purpoſe of their hearts with the Goſpel endeavors of their lives, ſet upon purity: for from the context <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. they were his diſciples he ſpake unto, whom <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 20.) he pronounced poor in Spirit: Bleſſed are <hi>ye poor;</hi> not yet enriched with all perfections, but ſenſible of their ſpiritual wants: and <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. they are mourners under ſin, and after more of God and Chriſt: <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. they are hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſs, not yet filled; but bleſſed in their preſent ſtate of hunger and thirſt, and in their hopes (by that promiſe) of being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Theſe are the pure in heart whom Chriſt pronounceth bleſſedneſs upon, who are poor mourning ſouls, hungring and thirſting after more purity; in the mean time not Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical and hypocritical in their profeſſion of holineſs, as were others. And had theſe been pure in heart in <hi>R. F.</hi> his ſenſe, they had then enjoyed the perfect beatifical viſion of God, which they have but a promiſe of: for they that are
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115729:99"/> ſincere in holineſs have here ſome communion with God, and one day and to all eternity they ſhall enjoy him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his preſence in fulneſs of that holineſs and joy, whereof now they have but the taſts and firſt-fruits. He that boaſteth of more, hath neither (as I ſaid in my former piece) pure lip nor pen for the leaſt degree (how much more larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures?) of purity, maketh a ſoul ſenſible of continual impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities intermixed therewith.</p>

                     <p>But ſaith <hi>R. F.</hi> (to mar, not mend his own caſe) <hi>He ſaid to ſuch as had attained it, preſs others on after it, and they did,</hi> Heb. 6. 1.</p>

If he joyns himſelf with the <hi>many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> then muſt the word [perfect] in the 15. <hi>ver.</hi> be taken otherwiſe then in <hi>ver.</hi> 12.

What is that <hi>Law of ſin?</hi> The condemning power of ſin (yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent and permanent:) As if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have ſaid, If ſin that wars and fights in me, hath no power to condemn me, then there is no condemnation to me; (the ſentence, <hi>that</hi> is cut off, and where no ſentence paſſeth, there is no exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution according to Law.) But ſin hath no Law, no power to condemn me; for the Law of grace and holineſs in Chriſts own fleſh, condemned ſin there, kept off filth from him, and condemned all my guilt charged upon him; ſo as ſin is put out of office, and cannot ſo much as ſerve a Writ of condemnation upon me: nor can ſin have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power over me (while it dwelleth in me) ſeeing the Spirit which dwelleth in Chriſt, brings life and power from him, to quicken holineſs and kill ſin in me; and that grace which reigneth in Chriſt, reigneth in me, while ſin is rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

Haply, the ſimple heart will ſay, he meaneth ſorrow for ſin, as ſin, paſt, and preſent; paſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, preſent ſtirrings, and inclinations to ſin; Doth he ſo? then he muſt deny his doctrine of preſent perfection true of ſome Saints, you will ſay; but then he diſclaimeth godly ſorrow in the reſt that are already perfect, and free from the matter of ſorrow, as I ſaid above, and ſo he will put them (if not himſelf and ſome imperfect ones) among the ninety nine that need no Repentance, which yet is not ſo with them in reality, but in ſuppoſition. If you ſay, they preach that men ſhould repent; I ask, how ſhall the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſorrow after a godly maner? If they lay the burden upon the ungodly onely, and abſolve the godly altogether, they may by that way preach down all godly ſorrow, and ſtartle the wicked with legal convictions, and that which is remorſe of conſcience, but no way help toward the pulling down the old man, or building up the new, in the true Believer.</p>

I deny that God did ever, or will ever reveal himſelf by any of thoſe things thou calleſt the means of grace,</hi> which were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before in his book, as, <hi>reading, hearing, prayer, &amp;c.</hi> contrary to 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. Rom. 10. 17. Luke</hi> 11. 13. &amp;c. <hi>R. F.</hi> in anſwer <note n="*" place="margin">Page 19.</note> ſaith <hi>I would raiſe a ſlander,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as if they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115729:105"/> ſhould deny the way and means that God uſeth to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his people by.</hi> How makes he it to appear? why, <hi>Chriſt is the light, and the way to the Father, and that they own; and he reveals his ſecrets by his Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> In all this confeſſion, here is no acknowledgement<note place="margin">Chriſt and the Spirit give light and grace by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means.</note> of <hi>reading, hearing, prayer, &amp;c.</hi> That Chriſt is the light, and light-giver, hath never been denyed by me; and that, with his Spirit he is the author and worker of all grace, who but graceleſs men will gain-ſay? We do, with the Scripture, attribute higher things to God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit, then to be the means of grace; but <hi>R. F.</hi> will not aſcribe ſo much to the Scriptures, read, heard, ſung, prayed upon (<hi>i. e.</hi> according to the rules, and patterns of prayer there ſet down) to be ſo much as outward means of grace; we can have no ſuch outward ingenuity from him: But what ſaith he? <hi>The Scriptures are not Chriſt, nor the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> What if they be not, they are Chriſts word, and the word of the Spirit, as hath been ſhewed; and what the Scripture ſaith, Chriſt ſaith, and the holy Ghoſt alſo the ſame; He therefore that rejects the Scripture, and its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exerciſes from being the means of grace, rejecteth Chriſt and his Spirit alſo. But the <hi>Spirit</hi> he ſaith, <hi>teacheth us how to pray, and profit.</hi> Gal. 4. 6. 1 Cor. 12. 7. &amp;c. and <hi>this doth not contradict the Scriptures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> No, for the Spirit of grace, and the outward means agree very well, yet this is not a yielding them to be the means [<hi>by which</hi>] Chriſt and the Spirit revealeth their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and convey grace. It is one thing for the Spirit to teach how to pray, and read, another thing for the Spirit to work by reading, praying &amp;c we grant the former, but he grants not the latter (as he ought) that I can finde. Yes, may ſome ſay, what think you of that which followeth? <hi>we know that faith is given by the miniſtery of Chriſt in the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> But ſpeak plainly, is it given by reading and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures opened and preached? as, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. Rom.</hi> 10. 17. hold it forth; And <hi>we know that God giveth us his holy Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> But doth he give it in a way of preaching and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115729:106"/> prayer? as <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 44. and <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. bear teſtimony. As ſoon as <hi>Paul</hi> is converted, is he not at Prayer, and had he not the fillings of the Spirit given him in that way, as by <hi>Ananias</hi> putting his hands upon him? <hi>Act. 9. 11. 17. And the wiſdom,</hi> ſaith <hi>R. F. which is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be entreated; and the fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace, of them that make peace,</hi> James 3. 17, 18. <hi>for which we praiſe God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. But doth he give this wiſdom by asking? as ſaith <hi>James.</hi> 1. 6. If any lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God; is not prayer a means of wiſdom?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I wiſh we could finde the wiſdom <hi>James</hi> deſcribeth in <hi>R. F.</hi> As yet I diſcern not any ſeeds of it ſown in his books, one or other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let him beware of taking Gods name in vain, by praiſing him legibly, in print, for that which he hath not printed in his heart, nor holdeth forth viſibly in practiſe. Why, but he addeth, <hi>we own reading, hearing, prayer, and the teachings of God according to his promiſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> I wiſh he doth well underſtand the promiſes of<note place="margin">Means of grace have a promiſe of bleſſing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</note> God. Gods promiſes are made of a bleſſing upon ſuch means, as reading, hearing and prayer, as well as of gracious abilities to read, hear and pray with, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55. 3. He that heareth, and inclines his ear, ſhall live, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13. 16. If <hi>Timothy</hi> attend to reading, meditation, preaching to others watching himſelf, In doing this he ſhall ſave himſelf, and thoſe that hear him.

They ſhall look unto him, and run to him, and their faces ſhall not be aſhamed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 5. why ſo? <hi>Ver</hi> 6. This poor man cryed and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his troubles; and therefore we may from others experiences, together with our own, have hope, <hi>Rom</hi> 5. 4. And Hope, in and by a promiſe, an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental promiſe and a promiſed experience, maketh not aſhamed. If therefore <hi>R. F.</hi> doth own theſe means, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115729:106"/> the teachings of God <hi>according to Gods promiſes,</hi> he muſt own them otherwiſe then <hi>C.

                     <p n="2">2. No reaſon is given for his denial of ſprinkling Infants with water, which I called <hi>Sacramental water,</hi> but he puts it upon a Quere, <hi>Canſt thou prove it?</hi>

                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:115729:107"/>1. Sacramental water, or Baptiſmal water, or Baptiſm with water, let it be called any of theſe, it matters not which.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Baptiſm of Children, or Infants.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A ſprinkling Baptiſm, or application of water by ſprinkling or putting water upon the party baptized.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, What more clear then the appointment and uſe of<note place="margin">Baptiſm with Water proved.</note> water-Baptiſm?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Water was appointed by God to be uſed as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward material ſign of inward ſpiritual waſhing, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 33. He that ſent me to baptize with water, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Where there was much water, there were many bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and the ſooner diſpatched, as not onely at <hi>Jordan,</hi> but in <hi>Aenon,</hi> near to <hi>Salim,</hi> John 3. 23. and at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 2. 41. Where there was no water, the ordinance could not be adminiſtred, and therefore the Eunuch till he came where water was, called not for it, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36. See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? <hi>Philips</hi> anſwer, If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt, hath no ſuch intendment, as <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Martin Maſon</hi> in his Reply to <hi>Jonathan Johnſon,</hi> p 8</note> one puts upon it; to <hi>intimate water-Baptiſm to be a thing indifferent,</hi> nor any ſuch ſenſe as he would dawb upon it, with his untempered morter: <hi>viz. As much as if he had ſaid, If thou believeſt outward water to be neceſſary to ſalvation, thou mayeſt be baptized, &amp;c.</hi> For the Eunuchs Reply (out of which the ſcope and ſenſe of <hi>Philips</hi> anſwer is to be gathered) is not touching his faith of the neceſſity of water, (of which he ſtood convinced that the uſe of it in Baptiſm was an ordinance) but reſpecting his faith of Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the inward Baptiſm of the Spirit, and that by extraordinary gifts of Tongues was obtained, it ſufficed not; but the ordinance of Sacramental-water muſt be obeyed, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47. Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, &amp;c. And <hi>ver.</hi> 48. He commanded them to be baptized. Whoſoever is againſt Baptiſmal-water, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids or denies that which <hi>Peter,</hi> by the Lords authority, dares any man to forbid.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When <hi>Paul</hi> baptized <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houſhold, the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115729:107"/> Jaylor and all his, <hi>Criſpus, Gaius,</hi> and the houſhold of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanas,</hi> what was it but with water? He could do no more then <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> except in exerciſe of gift of tongues and miracles, and laying on of hands upon thoſe that were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized before, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6. with 4.</p>

And that baptizing with water is meant in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. is clear enough, becauſe Chriſt reſerved the gift of the inward Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm to himſelf, but he commandeth his Apoſtles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to give forth the outward, as ſubſervient to his ſaving ends and purpoſes. And although we prefer the inward, before the outward part of one and the ſame Baptiſm; yet we muſt not reject the outward part, becauſe the inward is to be preferred. It will not excuſe <hi>R. F.</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Page 20.</note> or any man to tell us, <hi>Yet Baptiſm by one Spirit we own,</hi> while water-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is wholly diſ-owned. Nor do the Scriptures which he produceth for the Baptiſm by the Spirit, exclude the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm with water, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13. The Apoſtles ſcope in<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12, 13. cleared and vindicated</note> the Chapter is, to preſs on to a right uſe of ſpiritual gifts, by every member, for the good of the whole body, as from other Arguments, ſo from this, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. The body is one, though the members are many. How is it proved, that the Church is one body? becauſe <hi>ver.</hi> 13. by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body: Hence the force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for right imparting of gifts; If we all agree in the ſame Spirit, and are taught by one Spirit, and baptized into one body, why ſhould not our gifts be uſed for the mutual good of the members, the whole, and every part of the body? Now, what is in the inward part of Baptiſm, among other things, incorporation, that is held forth by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part. Water-Baptiſm, declares and ratifies our being
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115729:108"/> ſet, ingraffed, and joyned to the body myſtical, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>There is one Body, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm.</hi> Is it<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 4, 5. vindicated.</note> enough for <hi>R. F.</hi> to mention this? Here is nothing intended againſt Baptiſmal-water, by the Apoſtle, what ever be mens intentions now adays. It's a wreſting of the Scriptures, though the bare words be but mentioned, to quote them for another end then they were written. Both the inward and outward waſhing are appointed by <hi>one Lord,</hi> to confirm <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Faith;</hi> and they make but one and the ſame Baptiſm, which conſiſteth of the ſign and the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. He that would divide them, or more then diſtinguiſh them, croſſeth the minde of the Lord Jeſus. Whatſoever <hi>R. F.</hi> addeth, <hi>Such as are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt; and that we witneſs, as doth the Scripture, which is not contradiction, Gal.</hi> 3. 27. The Scripture witneſſeth the<note place="margin">Gal. 3 27. vindicated.</note> outward part, and the inward; and the Apoſtle intendeth both in this place; for preſſing faith in Chriſt alone for Juſtification, without dependence upon any of our acts, in obedience to the Law; he draweth an Argument from Baptiſm, the outward part as well as the inward: As many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt for Juſtification alone; as if he ſhould ſay, Ye did ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally put on Chriſt in Baptiſm, you muſt not now put him off, and be clothed with your own rags again, in ſtead of his robes. He that denieth either part of compleat Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm (as the Scripture expreſſeth it of Water, and of the Spirit) hath ſo much Contradiction to the Scripture in his denial.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As to the Baptiſm of Infants, what ever <hi>R. F.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Infant Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm Chriſts inſtitution.</note> thinketh (with many others) that <hi>it is an Invention, and none of Chriſts Inſtitution;</hi> The grounds from Scripture for the Affirmative, muſt be raiſed, otherwiſe then he undertakes it, ere I will clear him of his Chriſt and Scripture-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in this very particular. To thoſe two Arguments I produced from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. mentioned in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Section, he ſaith little or nothing; nothing at all to the latter, and little to the former, and that as falſly, as weakly; according to his wonted language: <hi>But thou perverts the Scripture,</hi> Acts 2. 38, 39. <hi>ſaying, Be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115729:108"/> every one of you; you and your children: Here thou art a lyar, it doth not command Children to be baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> neither <hi>did they ever ſo baptize them, that thou canſt prove, by one plain Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. He attends not my reaſon, which I muſt repeat, for help to his memory, or others underſtanding: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand there reacheth as far as the Promiſe; the Promiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to Children, not to all, but to their children, [<hi>To you and to your children is the Promiſe made,</hi>] and therefore the Command [Be baptized every one of you] is made to the Parent, and concerning the Childe, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo of ſuch Parents, as gladly receive the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for them and theirs, as it is ſaid they did, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. And although it is not there <hi>plainly</hi> expreſt, the Children and Infants were baptized, yet the Promiſe is plain enough, and the Precept is explained and enforced by the Promiſe; which had been of far leſs force to the Jew, and Proſelyte alſo, if <hi>their Children</hi> (formerly circumciſed upon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents taking hold of the Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 6.) had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and left un-baptized; and why may not the yongeſt be included with the eldeſt among thoſe three thouſand ſouls? (according to Scripture-phraſe elſewhere, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 26, 27.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Why ſhould <hi>R. F.</hi> (if he were not unreaſonable) tye me, or himſelf, to <hi>one plain Scripture?</hi> That which one place giveth not forth ſo plainly, another compared with it, may explain that and its ſelf alſo.

                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26.

His Church, his myſtical body, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. How? <hi>By water, and the word;</hi> both which are the outward means, by which he applies his Blood and Spirit, to all that he cleanſeth. The <hi>water</hi> diſtinguiſht here from the grace of ſanctifying and cleanſing, can be no other then Baptiſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water: <hi>The word</hi>

                           </gap>.</note> in this place diſtinguiſht from Chriſt himſelf, can be no other then the Scripture-command for the uſe of water; and the Scripture-promiſe, for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of water to the ends he hath appointed it in Baptiſm.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115729:109"/> The Scripture-promiſe, we have found, belongeth to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the Scripture-command for the uſe of water to all that have the Promiſe, and to all that are of Chriſts myſtical body. Now ſome Children will be found to belong to his body, the Church. I hope <hi>R. F.</hi> will think, if he doth not, others will believe, the Scripture is plain enough for that, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. In one Verſe we read of <hi>Infants,</hi> in another, of <hi>little Children,</hi> whom Chriſt owned, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Kingdom of God: The Kingdom of God, and the true Church that is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 1. differ not an hairs-breadth: of ſome of that age, or non-age (we may call it) of yong ones, and little ones, is Chriſts body made up in part; yea, he is ſo far from ſetting all Infants by, and ſhutting them out, that he profeſſeth with vehemency, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Verily, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God, as a little Childe, ſhall in no wiſe enter therein. Let <hi>R.

They were all baptized, in the cloud, and in the ſea; ſome might be more drencht or wet then others; but they (whether yong or old, whether more or leſs waſhed, or moiſtned with water) were <hi>all</hi> baptized. It is not the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, but the quality, and uſe of water that was then, and is now ſignificative in Baptiſm. The general end and uſe of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115729:109"/> water is waſhing, (the effect whereof is cleanſing) and ſuch is the uſe and force of the word, (as before) hence I reaſon,

                           <item>That action which fully repreſenteth the main end and uſe of Baptiſmal-water, is lawful and ſufficient:</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>For the main general end, and uſe of Water-baptiſm, is to ſignifie ſpiritual waſhing and cleanſing of the ſoul from ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 16. Ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins: and this is done ſignificatively, by a ſprinkling-Baptiſm (of yong or old) as well as by a dipping.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When <hi>John</hi> baptized Chriſt, and <hi>Philip</hi> the Eunuch, their going down to the water was one action, and the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing another. I ſtand not convinced by any plain, or forcible Scripture-phraſe, or by any circumſtance in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-hiſtory, that there was any other action, or rite of baptizing (when it came to that) then ſprinkling or caſting water upon the perſon baptized.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sprinkling, or putting water upon the baptized, is the more ready and eaſie action; and Chriſt hath not burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Church in the New Teſtament with painful Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Dipping and plunging, is either of the whole body, or of a part onely: if but of a part, it is hazardous and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom, not onely to Infants, but to perſons of years. Once upon a time, I asked a neighbor of mine (who was for Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping) how <hi>Paul</hi> dipped the Jaylor? his anſwer was, He took him plum up from the ground, and put him into the water. (By the way I told him, there had need be good ſtore of ſtrength in all Adminiſtrators of Baptiſm in this maner, and little <hi>Paul</hi> might not be ſtrong enough for the ſervice, if <hi>Silas</hi> was) I asked again, whether there was a pond or river in the yard, betwixt the priſon and the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors proper lodgings; and was anſwered, there might be a brook running through the yard. Theſe are ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, which men will aſſume and fancy to themſelves. I may ask again, what brook or pond was there in <hi>Judas</hi>'s houſe, where <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11. who when weak and feeble was baptized, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and was not ſtrengthned in body till he had received meat, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. ſure, ſprinkling or
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115729:110"/> putting a little water upon <hi>Paul</hi> at that time, and at all times upon feeble Infants, as upon feeble <hi>Paul,</hi> is a work of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mercy, which God prefers before ſacrifice. Who may not obſerve, that dippers, and the dipped are more put to their ſhifts, to make out their way by Scripture, then we are ſtraitned, to prove a ſprinkling Baptiſm, or a waſhing by ſprinkling, or ſuch kinde of application of water to the party? And therefore if water be appointed by Chriſt, and Infants are not excluded the Covenant and Promiſe wherein their parents (if but one) do ſtand; and if ſprinkling or caſting water upon the Church-member, or confederate with God, and his people, be ſufficient, and ſuitable to the main end of Baptiſm, I apprehend we depart not from the minde of Chriſt revealed in Scripture, when we <hi>ſo</hi> Baptize them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As I forbear judging of Saints who differ in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward notions, and outward forms, ſo I cannot but condemn this ſect of men, who are againſt all outward Baptiſm with water, what way, or to what perſons ſoever it be applyed; and vent many falſhoods and abſurdities in their dictates concerning the baptiſm of the Spirit onely.

That natural body and blood of Chriſt (which we remember in the Supper, as broken and ſhed at his Paſſion) was and is a true natural body, (then on earth, now in heaven) and yet it was and is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual food; his fleſh, <hi>meat indeed,</hi> his blood, <hi>drink indeed;</hi> there is no ſweeter, no better; there's none to that: So the bread and wine, is truly bread, materially wine, and yet withal, in the Lords Supper it is Chriſts body, and it is his blood; How? ſignificatively; a ſpiritual memorial of Chriſts death, and a pledge of what Chriſt is (to us that believe in him) dying for us.</p>

Hence<note place="margin">The benefit of the Lords Supper.</note> it is, that the Churches of Chriſt, and every true believer, active in his faith, have found it, and do ſtill experience it to be a faith-ſtrengthning, conſcience-refreſhing, ſoul-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, love-increaſing, ſin-mortifying, ſalvation-aſſuring Ordinance; although they have not always a like ſenſe of his preſence.

And I ſubjoyn, It is not our eating every day in fear and moderation (as it ought to be) that will mortifie a luſt, but onely give a check of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: Bodily exerciſe of faſting profiteth little that way. Acting of faith upon Chriſts death every day will do much, as well out of meals, as at them; yea, he that doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Chriſt at his plowing, and ſowing, when he lieth down, when he riſeth up, goeth out, or cometh in; or at other times, as at break-faſt, dinner or ſupper, will go near to forget him then: But that we may never forget him, and his death, and his power and love to take away our ſin, he hath left us his ſolemn ſacred Supper, as an inſtituted means
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115729:117"/> of a Remembrance of him, to be uſed as oft as with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency we can meet at his Table.</p>
                     <p>Let not <hi>J.

None have impoſitions upon them for once a moneth. Were hearts and purſes large enough in all the Churches, they might meet every firſt day of the week (our Chriſtian Sabbath-day, a day that the Lord hath made for ſolemn conventions and exultations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 24) at the Lords Table.

                        <hi>ORdaining of Elders was not by man,</hi> ſaid one; this I noted as contrary to <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. where by the direction and aſſiſtance of the Apoſtles, with the ſuffrages, or conſenting voices, and geſtures of the Brethren, in the Churches, Elders (Teaching and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) were ordained; or being choſen, were ſet apart to their office, by Prayer and faſting, in every Church. <hi>R.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115729:122"/> againſt it, then I have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But for that which concerneth Ordination, <hi>I again affirm,</hi> ſaith <hi>J. Nayler, that the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Elders by the direction of the Spirit, was not by man, nor of man, nor any created power,</hi> &amp;c. The wiſe-hearted here appealed to, will ſoon grant, that which they never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, That the direction of the Spirit was his own, not mans; and the <hi>gift of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> was his gift: But if the holy Ghoſt makes uſe of the Apoſtles, and of the Churches, to chuſe and ſet Elders apart, as he did; then the <hi>wiſe-hearted</hi> will conclude agaiſt <hi>J. Nayler:</hi> this call is not immediate, but mediate; a <hi>call of God by man,</hi> or by the miniſtery and ſervice of man, and is not diſproved by what he hath ſaid to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>What hath <hi>R. F.</hi> to ſay againſt it? <hi>This I ſay, The holy Ghoſt made Overſeers, and ſo Elders in the Church,</hi> Acts<note place="margin">Acts 20. 28. vindicated.</note> 20. 28. <hi>and the holy Ghoſt is not ſuch men as you are.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. It were well for <hi>R. F.</hi> if he knew what or who the holy Ghoſt is. Under that Head of the Trinity (as before <hi>Section</hi> 7.) he was no perſon, in his judgement, diſtinct from the Father and the Son; and now he tells us, he is not <hi>ſuch men</hi> as we are: Why, what is he? Is he a man, or Angel? ſpeak out <hi>R. F.</hi> tell us what he is in thy judgement: for in ours, and according to the grounds of our faith, laid down in Scripture, he is neither <hi>ſuch men,</hi> as we, or the Sect of men, called Quakers; nor is he ſuch a perſon as man, nor is he man or Angel, but the very God. And as he is God with the Father, and the Son, ſo he is a divine perſon diſtinct from the perſonal ſubſiſtences of the Father and the Son, as hath been proved above.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What the Father and the Son do, he doth, as to the making of Overſeers, or Biſhops and Elders: he gives the office, he deſigns the officer, he furniſheth the Elders with graces and gifts fitting for the function, and he directeth the Church by his word and rule, whom to chuſe and ſet apart, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Yea, he approveth of mens ſervice in the ſetting apart of men to this, as other offices; he made uſe of the Prophets and Teachers at <hi>Antioch,</hi> to <hi>ſeparate him</hi> Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the work whereunto he had appointed them,</hi> as <hi>R.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115729:123"/> but it offends me, and much more the holy and true God, when his words are alledged to bad ends and purpoſes, and when more is collected from them then he intendeth; as in this caſe of Miniſters maintenance, and in theſe inſtances of<note place="margin">Preaching freely may ſtand with taking main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</note> the Apoſtles words and practiſe: For,</p>
                     <p>[Firſt,] Preaching the Goſpel freely, may ſtand with taking allowance and maintenance three ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When it is preached with a free and cheerful Spirit, as it ſhould be always, by all the Preachers of the Goſpel, not by conſtraint, but willingly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2.</p>

They give, they contribute nothing; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is demanded of them, but ſupplies are given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from other perſons, or places: This was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles caſe in reference to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> he preached all upon free-coſt <hi>to them,</hi> took nothing <hi>of them;</hi> but took he nothing of others?

                     <p n="1">1.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115729:128"/> This onely for order ſake; not but that the doctrine from Scripture was as infallible as the Revelation; and the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation was to paſs the trial, as the doctrine, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. and 32.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In ſo much as women are excluded from this kinde of propheſie, by two or three at a time, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. with <hi>ver.</hi> 34. But if it had been extraordinary predictions of things to come, they, <hi>i. e.</hi> women, might have delivered their meſſage.</p>

Now if they had been Paſtors and Teachers in office ſtrictly, there was no queſtion but they might have preached at all ſeaſons, when the Church met together, and a neceſſity is laid upon them, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; a liberty onely is granted to theſe Prophets, and that liberry is limited alſo, as before. Would <hi>R.

Such is that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, Chap. 1. 9. God is my witneſs, &amp;c.</hi> And to the <hi>Corinthians, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 23. Moreover, <hi>I call God for a record,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <note place="margin">James 5. 12. vindicated.</note> hath been cleared already, and the conſideration of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, doth further vindicate the prohibition from theſe mens opinions: <hi>Leſt ye fall into temptation;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Swear by any, but by God, or ſwear by God, raſhly, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately, in a ſtrait and extremity, and ye will fall into temptation: from ſwearing ye may be tempted to curſe God, and yet further blaſpheme him; and from ſwearing by Creatures, ye may be tempted openly to worſhip them, and run from the true God to plain idols and idolatry; and from preſumption, ye may be tempted to deſpair; therefore patiently endure, do not paſſionately rap out oaths. But as to <hi>J. Naylers</hi> diſtinction of the time, when an oath was lawful, when not; I muſt ſend him to <hi>Section</hi> 17. to let him
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115729:139"/> know, that the old Covenant and the new, was the ſame for ſubſtance; even the ſame Covenant of grace, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth now as then, by way of love and thankfulneſs, to ſwear by the Lords name: and if we live under a clearer and larger adminiſtration of the Goſpel-covenant, wherein God hath fulfilled his oath, that he made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> by ſending his Son; and that he made to his Son, to conſecrate him a high Prieſt for ever; we ſhould reckon our ſelves more obliged to ſwear our ſelves to the Lord for ever, then thoſe that lived under the old Teſtament.

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. As his minde is given out by it, whether the words be proper or figurative, the Spirit hath his proper intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſcope and ſenſe in the whole Letter, and in every part of what is written; and as by his words he makes known his minde, he is where his words are.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As his work is given by it; even what work he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,<note place="margin">See ſecond part, Section 10.</note> of Conviction, Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. If the Scripture convinceth gainſayers, and ſinners, evil livers; if it inſtructeth the ignorant, comforteth the feeble-minded, it is as the Spirit gives out himſelf thereby. He is there indeed as a free Agent, <hi>ad placitum,</hi> not tyed to work, or manifeſt himſelf, or put forth his power and grace; but as the wind bloweth where it liſteth, ſo he worketh, where, when, and upon whom he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As the Promiſes of the Scripture are his Chariot to convey him whither he pleaſeth to go; into the hearts of the Elect, that they may believe; and after they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that they may be eſtabliſhed. Thus, according to his promiſe, he will fill a Believers ſails of endeavor, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, meditating, &amp;c. with gales of grace, and advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards glory. To conclude, that the Spirit is in the Letter, and given by it, daily experience doth demonſtrate: For ſuch as forſake the Scriptures authority, and own not the Spirits dwelling in the Letter, as truly as in the heart, they loſe their faith of the Spirits preſence with them, in the reading and meditation of it, and loſing this faith, they run to other Doctrines and Goſpels. The ſpirit of error is in all mens doctrines which have not the Spirit in them, that brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth in the Scriptures. We may eaſily diſcern whether <hi>R. F.</hi> his ſpirit be not in his writings, and whether much of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115729:147"/> the ſpirit of Error, not conveyed and given out by his and other mens Pamphlets of the ſame ſtamp. And ſhall the ſpirit of Satan, the father of lyes, be in Seducers books; and not the Spirit of God, and of the Father of truth, be in, and go along (according to his free mercy) with his own bleſſed Books of the Scripture? Yes verily, and <hi>James Naylers</hi> words import as much, when he ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">Few words by <hi>J.</hi> N. p. 11.</note>, <hi>That the Spirit opens, and brings all that is ſpoken in Scripture to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;</hi> which if <hi>R.

                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. How would I have him that believeth born of the Letter? my words were theſe, <hi>If the Scripture be in the heart of every one, ſure he that believeth is born of that ſeed;</hi> even of the Scripture-promiſe ſet into the heart by the holy Ghoſt; hence, he that is born of the Spirit, is born of the word, written and preached, which the Spirit uſeth as the inſtrumental means of our regeneration; as upon that place in <hi>Peter, 1 Ep. Chap. 1. ver.</hi> 23, and 25. hath been cleared heretofore, <hi>Part 1. Sect.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Scripture-promiſe, declaring Chriſt, is the more apt means by which the Spirit begets a ſoul to Chriſt, or formeth him in the ſoul.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the Letter declareth Chriſt, doth not contradict the Scripture; but it contradicteth the Scripture to ſay, the declaration of Chriſt is not a means of begetting a ſoul to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To ſay, <hi>Let all ſee whether we do not ſet the Scripture in the heart of every one,</hi> and yet to deny the Scripture to be a means of the new birth, or that the believer is born of God <hi>without the Scripture,</hi> is to ſay and un-ſay.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>R. F.</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">page 26.</note> would retort this upon my ſelf, and why? I <hi>have not the ſame minde</hi> with them, <hi>and know not their meaning, and ſo raiſe lyes</hi> (as he chargeth upon me) <hi>by my imaginations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. If I have the minde of Chriſt, as it is in Scripture, I ſhall not be ambitious of, nor much regard their meaning: but as I know it to be croſs to the minde of Chriſt, I have (according to the grace given unto me) witneſſed againſt it, and yet ſtudied to put the moſt candid and favorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon their words.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If their ſenſe, of <hi>ſetting Scripture in the heart of every one,</hi> be nothing elſe, but telling people they have a light of Conſcience within them, and ſtirring up that light which every man hath that cometh into the world; Firſt, they delude poor people, who never heard <hi>that</hi> Light called Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture before; yet this is, more then probably, their beſt Scripture for their Tenents and Doctrines, (as might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the anſwer that <hi>J. P.</hi> a yong ſtripling, who came into this Town laſt ſummer, gave to a weak re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115729:148"/> woman, ſhattered by his diſcourſe; whoſe queſtion was, <hi>But may I not read the Scriptures?</hi> The anſwer was, <hi>Read thy heart woman,</hi> (as ſhe told me) that was all ſhe could get of him.) There is a book of Conſcience to be read indeed, but is not the book of the Scriptures, and Gods Statutes to be read? according to which (beyond the book of every mans Conſcience) all that have that written rule ſhall be judged.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If every mans light be the onely Scripture, in the minde that theſe men are in, why doth <hi>R. F.</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">In his Book entituled, <hi>A true teſtimony,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 53.</note> appeal to that which is the alone, proper, perfect Scripture in our judgement, and which he calls for, to <hi>ſtand as judge betwixt them and 42. Miniſters?</hi> Will he ſtand to the judgement of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as it is the minde of Chriſt the word of God? Will he not appeal (when all is done) to a higher Court, of immediate Teachings in the heart? If the Scripture be judge, it muſt be ſo from its own light, that is ſuperior, not onely to every mans light, but alſo to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of light that is in every Saint, and that is ſuperior to our meanings and theirs; for the Scripture muſt judge by its own words and meaning together; and from its own rule, we muſt not ſeparate the Letter of the Law, and the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Letter. The Law-makers, we ſay, are beſt able to give the right ſenſe of the Law. The great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver gives out his ſenſe of one part of Scripture by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. <hi>Can any Law judge of Hereſie but the Law of God?</hi> ſaith <hi>R. F.</hi> in the Book and Page laſt referred unto in the margent. If he intends there any Law of God, but the written word and text of the Bible, Gods great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, he contradicts in heart what he pretends to in words. If he underſtands by the Law of God, the holy Scriptures of God, (called the Bible) then he pretends to that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of them as a ſtanding rule, and a more ſtanding rule then viſions and revelations; and if he intends what he pretends to, then he muſt recant what he wrote in the 3. and 4.

                     <p n="2">2. It followeth not, if men ſay true in one thing, that they ſpeak the truth in every thing. The devil can ſpeak a truth, the more cunningly, to put off his lyes. That may be a truth materially, which will not be found in mens practical experience ſo acknowledged.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is beyond all controverſie, that in this (as many other inſtances) they ſay and unſay; firſt owning the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and miniſtery, and hearing of the word, and then diſ-owning all teachers and teaching, but what is within: firſt ſaying, <note n="*" place="margin">A diſcovery of ſome fruits &amp;c. pag. 9.</note> the peoples <hi>Teacher cannot be removed into a corner,</hi> and by and by telling them, <hi>you will finde your teacher as you lye in your beds.</hi> Even as cuſtomary ſwearers

                     <p>Secondly, for the way of giving; Chriſt, as God, (as hath been ſhewed in the firſt part of this Reply) gives rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and common judgement about ſome things, to all men; but, as Mediator, he gives onely to ſome men, that ſaving ſupernatural light, or light of ſupernatural things in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way, which effectually brings them into a gracious life, and unto a glorious life.</p>

There was a pre-exiſtent ſubject before light was created, <hi>viz.</hi> darkneſs of the air; but no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent matter, which light was made of; much leſs was light there before within the darkneſs: (for though God commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, it doth not follow that <hi>light</hi> was there before) So, God working by his Almighty power in the new creation, he hath (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſhined in our hearts, to give the light (which was not there before) of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. The faculty of the natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was there, as the pre-exiſting ſubject, but there was no fore-exiſting matter, out of which this light is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The Apoſtles ſenſe again, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. is not to<note place="margin">Gal 1. 16. vindicated.</note> favor theſe mens opinion, as if Chriſt had been in <hi>Paul</hi> vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, before converſion, and then revealed in him, as being there, but <hi>Paul</hi> did not know it till his converſion: But God revealed his Son in <hi>Paul,</hi> when he did immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, effectually, and experimentally ſhine into his heart, and gave him the knowledge of the glorious myſteries of the Goſpel, in the clear knowledge of Chriſt given for him, given to him, and now dwelling in him; and he doth reveal his Son in others ordinarily, when, after he hath knockt at their hearts, he opens the door by his Spirit, gives faith to conſent, that Chriſt ſhall come in and dwell there, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. Before faith, Chriſt is kept out of the heart; but
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115729:151"/> when a ſoul believes, and his faith worketh by love, and love by obedience, as Chriſt came in and took poſſeſſion from firſt believing, ſo, in his good time, he doth manifeſt himſelf unto the ſoul, <hi>John</hi> 14. 21. The Apoſtles ſenſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 27. vindicated.</note> is not, as if the light of Chriſt for ſalvation, had been in the Gentiles hearts, in a myſtery, before their effectual calling: (The myſtery of ſalvation by Chriſt, was wrapt up in the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, and in Types and Figures among the Jews, not in the leaſt hinted to the Gentiles mindes before the Goſpel came) But when the Apoſtles<note place="margin">When and how Chriſt is in the ſoul.</note> came to preach Chriſt crucified to their ears, through grace they believed the report for themſelves, at <hi>Coloſs,</hi> (as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) and knew the grace of God in truth, had Chriſt his image ſtampt upon their hearts, and the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in them. This was not light breaking forth from their hearts, as having been <hi>there</hi> before their union with Chriſt, and Chriſts taking up their hearts as his Temple; but the light of the glorious Goſpel breaking into their hearts, which,</p>

Scripture-expreſſions he uſeth here as

F.</hi> tells us of a <hi>Judgement brought forth into victory;</hi> and when that is done, <hi>ſin is condemned in the fleſh:</hi> but, ſay I, according to Scripture, the Law written in the heart of every man, neither condemns all ſin, nor diſcovers either the root of all ſin, nor half the branches of it; and Judgement is far from coming forth into victory, till Chriſt brings it forth, not onely by Goſpel-conviction, (which is far beyond and above the conviction of a meer natural conſcience) but by Goſpel-ſanctification, and by his ſecond writing of the Law, not in old ſtony hearts, but in new and ſoftned hearts. But if natural conſcience be ſo potent to be victorious at laſt, why do they call every man in <hi>his firſt ſtate, a beaſt, his reaſon corrupt,</hi> but to manifeſt their Self-confuſions?</p>
                     <p>Again, he ſpeaks of ſin being condemned in the fleſh, a Scripture-expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. uſed by the Apoſtle, to ſet<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3. cleared.</note> forth Chriſts condemning ſin in his own fleſh, putting of it out of office and power (to condemn believers) by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering<note place="margin">Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſin in his fleſh, far beyond the conſcience condemnation of ſin.</note> of the puniſhment of their ſin in that fleſh of his; yea, fulfilling the Law, for them, in the ſame fleſh: Hence, no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus; but this is another kinde of condemning ſin, then what comes meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by and from a natural conſcience; for that,</p>

                     <p>The ſecond paſſage which <hi>R. F.</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Page 27.</note> undertakes to defend, is that of <hi>John Cam, Every man in his firſt birth and ſtate may ſee himſelf to be natural, but is not able to judge of the things of God.</hi> This is contradictious (in the firſt part of it) to <hi>Ben. Nicholſon,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Every man in his firſt ſtate is a beaſt,</hi> for then he can reflect upon himſelf, and judge of his ſtate before God, no more then a beaſt. And the ſecond part of it is contradictious to the firſt; for if every man in his firſt birth may ſee himſelf to be natural, (guilty, liable to ſin, and the curſe before God) then he may judge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the things of God: but that is denied, why then is the other affirmed? but that the man fought with himſelf in the dark.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>R. F.</hi> his defence is, 1. By railing and falſhood, <hi>Let that Book (Particulars concerning the Law by</hi> J. Cam) <hi>be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truth, againſt thy ignorance and ſottiſhneſs, that ſees thy corruptions, and pleads for them.</hi>

                        <hi>Rep.</hi> This I paſs by, with prayer, that the Lord may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and remit him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By a truth and a falſhood together, <hi>The light which doth diſcover the natural corruptions, is not natural, as thou ſays, but it is ſpiritual:</hi> Here is a truth in Scripture-ſenſe, not in his meaning; that the light which diſcovers natural corruption is ſpiritual; but a falſhood mixt with it, that I ſaid, it was natural. This will no where be found in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115729:153"/> or this preſent piece; for I every where deny the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light of every man to be able to diſcover a mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſtate: Reaſon cannot reach the breadth, nor fathom the depth of this fallen condition. But let <hi>R. F.</hi> compare his own words laſt ſpoken, with <hi>John Cam</hi>'s, and conſider if one doth not claſh with the other. His brother ſaith, <hi>Every man in his firſt birth may ſee himſelf to be natural:</hi> Himſelf ſaith, <hi>The light which doth diſcover natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, is not natural, but ſpiritual.</hi> Now I ask, Is it <hi>by the light</hi> of the firſt birth (as in the firſt birth) that every man may ſee himſelf to be natural? then that light is either natural, or ſpiritual; <hi>It is not natural,</hi> ſaith <hi>R. F.</hi> It is in <hi>the firſt birth,</hi> ſaith <hi>J. Cam:</hi> either theſe men do agree, or not; if they do agree with themſelves, it is more then we can make out by their words; onely I finde what their ſenſe is of the word [<hi>ſpiritual</hi>] not after the Scripture ſenſe: The Scripture meaneth by ſpiritual, that which is born of the Spirit; by ſpiritual light, the light of the new or ſecond birth: but theſe men underſtand by ſpiritual light, that which comes with the firſt birth, a light in the ſoul of every man. <hi>We know,</hi> ſaith <hi>James Nayler,</hi>

                        <hi>there is a light in ſpirit, that teſtifies of Chriſt, before Chriſt be known in the Creature;</hi> this light is that which the Gentiles had, <hi>whereby,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they became a law unto themſelves, and were Jews in ſpirit, whoſe praiſe was of God, and not of men.

This light and the fruits of it,</hi> he concludes, <hi>will ſtand at the day of judgement praiſed of God, but not of men.</hi> Which magnifying expreſſions of the Heathens light, are diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by what <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ben.

                     <p n="1">1. In that he boldly affirmeth, the Gentiles light made them <hi>Jews in ſpirit;</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29. hath no<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 29. reſcued.</note> ſuch meaning. He deſcribeth a Jew in ſpirit, to be one who
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115729:153"/> is circumciſed in heart, or who hath the circumciſion of the heart; whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God. Heart-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and the Gentiles light, are two things vaſtly diſcrepant: the Gentiles light never attained to the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of heart-circumciſion. Fond men that write and ſpeak after this maner! their pens and tongues would be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and hearts alſo, which I ſhall pray for, that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Errata's may be corrected.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In that (he ſaith) the Gentiles conſciences will bear them witneſs, <hi>and excuſe them in the day when God ſhall judge the world,</hi> &amp;c. all which is remote from the Apoſtles ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, He is comparing a practical Heathen, with a bare profeſſing Jew; and preferring the working Gentile, before the talking Jew; but how? as to matter of fact, not as to the whole ſtate before God: For, as to the whole ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, they are both alike, (both falling ſhort of what the Law written in the heart, or in the book, required) one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in matter of fact; the Heathen ſometime did more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his light, then the Jew did; but did the Heathen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his light perfectly? No, he had accuſing thoughts, as well as excuſing, a dark confuſed ſtate was his.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle doth not ſay, the Heathens light and fruits ſhall excuſe him ſo at the day of judgement, that they will ſtand at that day, praiſed of God, &amp;c. for then<note place="margin">No ſaving excuſe, or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony from a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> conſcience (fully awakened) will accuſe more then excuſe; and the accuſations will bear and weigh down the excuſes ten thouſand fold: nay, every mouth (and the mouth of every conſcience that now excuſeth but from his own acts, and hath not the ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus upon it) will then be ſtopt; where is his praiſe then of God?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The words <hi>ver.</hi> 16. In the day when God ſhall judge, &amp;c. though they immediately follow, yet they have not ſuch a connexion with <hi>ver.</hi> 15. but either refer to <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and ſo four verſes are to be taken into a Parentheſis, or to <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and ſo three verſes are parenthetically to be read, and the ſenſe, with ſuch a dependence obſerved, runs clear and plain; <hi>viz. ver.</hi> 11. There is no reſpect of perſons with God, in the day when God ſhall judge: or, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. As
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115729:154"/> many as have ſinned without the Law written, or with it, ſhall be judged, In the day when God ſhall judge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of men by Jeſus Chriſt: And this reading quite cuts off <hi>James Naylers</hi> plea for the Gentiles ſaving light.</p>
                     <p>What ſtarting-hole <hi>R. F.</hi> will have, we may gather by what went before and what follows, in his commendation of this light, and ſuch as love it: <hi>It is ſpiritual, and ſuch as love it, bring their deeds to be tryed by it, and with it the deceit is judged, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> But by the light of the Spirit ſhining in our hearts, by the Scripture, we have found out the deceit of terms and phraſes, as uſed by theſe men; and withal how they claſh with themſelves (as with the Scripture) even in that which <hi>R. F.</hi> addeth, <hi>Such as with the Light have the deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſcovered, and hates the Light, the Light is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> But ſay I, the Gentiles never perfectly loved that light they had, therefore it was and will be condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, and none of them will be excuſed in the day of judgement; and therefore <hi>R. F.</hi> and <hi>J Nayler</hi> are here at a difference, and contradict one another, it may be, when they conſider not of it.</p>
                     <p>For a farewel <hi>R. F.</hi> concludeth, <hi>As it</hi> [the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion] <hi>is thine, and they that are in union with corruptions, as thou art, they are not able to judge of the things of God, but erre in judgement that judgeth with evil thoughts, as thou doſt, and haſt done; therefore judgements is to thy head and crown of deceit, pride and vain glory.</hi>

In the other, I noted how <hi>George Fox</hi> diſparageth <hi>the light of knowing God, and the Father, and the Spirit, and Chriſt, and the Goſpel, by the Scriptures, becauſe men had never known them but by the Scriptures.</hi> One would think (as I ſaid) this to be rather a commendation of the Scriptures, and that his diſparagement contradicts his commendation; as his after commendation, <hi>That the Scriptures came from the light and life,</hi> contradicts his diſparagement, <hi>That the light within was before the Scriptures.</hi> The light, within Chriſt, was before, (we grant) in time, and excellency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncreated light. The light within every man, in <hi>Adam</hi> (conſidered as in his ſtate before the fall, or as in his lapſed condition) was before the Scriptures in time, not in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; becauſe the Scriptures hold forth a higher light, then either <hi>Adam</hi> (or we in him) had before the fall, or under the fall. The light within ſome Saints (as they were Saints) of the old Teſtament, was before any piece of Scripture in time, not in dignity and degree, ſeeing there is more light in the firſt piece of Scripture-Goſpel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. then all the Saints then, and ſince are worth (of themſelves) and then they could comprehend, or can to this day. The light within the Saints of the preſent Age, is after the Scriptures, both in time and excellency; in time, as they were born, and new-born ſince the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were extant: in excellency, as the Scriptures are a rule, above their light, and unto it; not ſo, their light a rule above the Scriptures.</p>

What hath he further to ſalve the contradiction? <hi>Thy imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot finde out the higheſt degree, that are not ſubject to the loweſt, but acts contrary to it, and ſo to be condemned by it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> Here are four freſh charges. For the firſt, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my imagination too ſhallow to reach unto others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; but I deny the higheſt degree of light to be here attainable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. I know 'tis in heaven to be found. I am content to look through <hi>Pauls</hi> glaſs, and the believers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, and to know things here in a Riddle, and in a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. The Zenith of the Saints light, is not to be ſeen while<note place="margin">Saints light not at the higheſt pitch.</note> we are under the Sun, when that which is perfect is come (which comes not in this life in point of light; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of holines, by the way) then that which is imperfect ſhall be done away: But this I know that I am more bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh then a man, and have not the knowledge of the Holy. And how little is the portion of the knowledge of God and Chriſt, that is to be found among all the Saints? were it all put together, it would, haply, amount but to the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that which ſhall be known, by every of them, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The knowledge of the love of Chriſt is the higheſt piece of knowledge, and that paſſeth my knowledge, if not <hi>R. Farnworths;</hi> yet this I know that nothing ſhall be known in heaven, nor to eternity, but the foundation and ſubject matter of it, is already laid in the Scripture. Beſides Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-knowledge
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115729:155"/> for the matter (I do not ſay for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) I profeſs my ſelf to know nothing; and the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that light which ſhineth in the Scripture, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and him crucified, I eſteem above the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the light that every man cometh into the world withal.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond charge followeth, <hi>But thou art not ſubject to the loweſt</hi> [degree of light.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Will <hi>R. F.</hi> grant the light which every man hath to be the loweſt light? and Goſpel-light to be a higher light? and what the Saints have in heaven to be higher then what the Saints have on earth? then I hope the leaſt degree of light is not perfect in its meaſures as in its ſelf, as his fellow aſſerted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What if I were perfectly ſubject to the leaſt and loweſt degree of light? will that advance me to light of another kinde? if not, I ſhall thank free grace for giving light of a higher nature (though I never obeyed natural light as I ought, and as I might; and every man might do more with his natural abilities then he doth.)</p>
                     <p>A third charge, <hi>But thou acts contrary to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> This I take to be a third winnowing of Satan. What I have done herein, the Lord hath known, and knows (and not <hi>R. F.</hi>) And He knows how to pardon it, and hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned it in Chriſt. But if I do not advance every mans light into the place of the Saints light, I act not againſt natural light (though above it) but for the light of Saints. And if I attribute more to true ſpiritual light, then to natural, and do not call that ſpiritual, which is not ſo (in the ſpecifical or proper form and being of it) but call a Spade a Spade, I hope <hi>R. F.</hi> will bear with me, or blame himſelf for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that diſtinction (as above) where he ſaid, <hi>the light which diſcovers corruption is not natural, but ſpiritual,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out explication of himſelf according to Scripture.</p>
                     <p>A fourth charge followeth [<hi>and ſo to be condemned by it</hi>] A ſentence I may call it, as well as a charge; but it is well I ſhall be condemned by the light, not in the dark as <hi>R. F.</hi> doth adjudge me, at his pleaſure: well, I ſay, that I ſhall be tryed and judged in another Court then his captious
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115729:156"/> judgement; and well for me ſtill, that I have ſubmitted to the ſentence of Gods legal Court for abuſe of natural light, and yet have made uſe of my liberty in Chriſt, to appeal unto a higher Court then Gods own Law (ſo far as it holds forth a Covenant of works, and ſentence of life or death upon my own works) even to the throne of Grace, and to the Goſpel-ſentence, of Gods free juſtifying a ſinner that believeth in Jeſus; there, I am ſure, neither <hi>R. F.</hi> nor the devil himſelf can lay any thing to my charge, as to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation before God. It is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? But in way of Reply before men, I muſt attend <hi>R. F.</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Page 27.</note> and deſire my Reader to obſerve how he goes on to make good <hi>J. Nayler</hi> his aſſertion. <hi>For it</hi> (the light in its leaſt meaſure) <hi>is perfect, both in reſpect of its truth, and ſincerity, power and authority, and condemns the haters and reſiſters of it.</hi> Thus <hi>R. F.</hi> To which I Reply,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What is this to perfection of degrees? Here is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fall from the higheſt to the loweſt, for this kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>viz.</hi> of truth (which I had granted) is ſo in the higheſt degree, that it belongs alſo to the loweſt. The leaſt drop of<note place="margin">Every thing is true, and perfect for the kinde, as it is Gods work.</note> water is true water, perfectwater in reſpect of its truth, as all that is in the Ocean: ſo the leaſt beam of light is true light, and (in that ſenſe) perfect, whether it be Creation-light, or Redemption-light, either is true (for its kinde) in the leaſt degree, and perfect as to the true being; But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The deceit lyeth here, when men will put off that for Redemption-light, which is but old Creation-light. A <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſtone is a true <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſtone, but if it be put off for a Diamond-ſpark, it is counterfeit; there is not truth in it, as to the repute and eſtimation of it: ſo, the leaſt degree of old Creation-light, (as <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that which may be<note place="margin">Rom 1. 19.</note> known of Gods eternal power, goodneſs and wiſedom, in and by the contemplation of the creature) is true for the kinde, and is called [<hi>truth] Rom.</hi> 1. 18. which the Gentiles impriſoned in unrighteouſneſs, but <hi>this</hi> hath not the leaſt ſpark of Redemption-light, which <hi>Adam</hi> had not before the fall, and was not manifeſted after the fall till the firſt promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And if it be commended, and ſet off for ſaving light, it proves falſe light, and darkneſs it ſelf, (ſo far is it
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115729:156"/> from perfection of degrees, that it hath not the leaſt ſpark of Goſpel-ſincerity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As for <hi>any power and authority,</hi> that the leaſt or the greateſt degree of old-creation-light hath (as it is given back ſince the fall) (though it be loved and obeyed) to lead into the life and power of the Saints comprehenſions of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming love of God in Chriſt (which <hi>R. F.</hi> hinteth at) I know none: God hath never bleſt it, nor promiſed to bleſs it, nor ordained it for that end.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If they intend it onely of the Saints light or the Spirits light, which <hi>R. F.</hi> in his Epiſtle ſaith <hi>is perfect in its leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> ſtill that is onely to be underſtood (as I ſaid in my other piece) in reſpect of its truth and ſincerity, and that hath life and power in it already, and doth not <hi>lead into it</hi> (as <hi>R. F.</hi> ſpeaks) but in reſpect of a further degree of the ſame kinde: for although the good uſe of natural light doth not lead into Spiritual light and life, yet the good uſe of the leaſt true ſpark of Spiritual ſaving light, in Chriſt the Mediator, hath a promiſe of further increaſe of light of the ſame Spiritual nature. There follows another paſſage in <hi>R. F.</hi> which I would ſcan a little, <hi>They</hi> that love and obey the leaſt degree of light, <hi>are in unity, the higheſt and loweſt in their meaſures and degrees.</hi>

After twelve years of age, he enquired where the chief Presbyterian Prieſts (as he calls them) preached, and heard them. At ſeventeen years of age he was ſtruck with terror, falls a praying; but by a voice was taken off prayer, reading, and hearing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; thought himſelf in the light; followed the higheſt Notioniſts; but had the world in his heart, pride and covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; lived in the luſtful nature, and grew to be weary of hearing any Prieſts, though never ſo high, for ſomething that ſhined deep in him, ſhewed him ignorance in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and he was put to a ſtand: Now hear him further, <hi>verbatim.</hi>

Let us hear <hi>J. Nayler</hi> ſpeak his minde, <note n="*" place="margin">Diſcovery of the man of ſin, pag. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>In your reply</hi> (meaning the Miniſters at <hi>Newcaſtle) you deceitfully put in that word (ſaving light) which is not ſpoken by me; for though Chriſt be the light of the world, that enlightens all, yet none are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him, but who believe,</hi> &amp;c. There is a light then which is in natural men, unbelievers, and all the Heathen, which is but natural, and a light which is not ſaving (and therefore but common) by their own confeſſion; what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs is it in them to except againſt the term of diſtinction? what contradiction to their own reaſon?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The preeminence of Scripture-light is this, that it is our ſtanding rule for faith and maners; ſo are not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelations or Teachings, of which ſee 1. Part, Sect. 1. Here is the Letter or Scripture-fulneſs that I aſſert, There is ſufficient light in it to guide men to ſalvation, ſeeing it is the Spirits light, and given by the Spirit for a rule; yea, the Spirit gives out himſelf thereby, for our clear underſtanding and ſatisfaction in the things of God; inſomuch as that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry witneſs which a believer hath in himſelf, the Scripture bears teſtimony of. The Spirit tells us in the Scripture what he worketh in our hearts, and he ſtamps upon our hearts what he had before cauſed to be ſtampt into Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or upon the Bible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>R. F.</hi> objecteth, <hi>Thou wouldſt have the Spirit to be bought and ſold, if it were in the Letter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> How the Spirit is in the Letter, that is, in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I have opened in its due place, 2. Part, Sect. 8. but that it followeth, it may therefore be bought and ſold, is a weak and poor exception. <hi>R. F.</hi> his minde goes along with his Pamphlet, and his ſpirit is in his book, yet it is not his perſon, but the ink and paper that is bought and ſold: ſo the ink and paper of the Scriptures (as other creatures of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115729:161"/> God) are bought and ſold; not ſo the Spirit, though he be more in them, then <hi>R. F.</hi> is in his book; for this poor man cannot change my minde, nor many thouſands more (if they read his Pamphlet with me) into his erroneous judgement; when as the Spirit, in the Scripture, changeth my minde, and all that are made to own the light and authority of it, into the ſame truth that is there delivered.</p>
                     <p>Again he taunteth, <hi>Thou wouldſt have a Letter-Savior, if the Letter could give the Spirit and eternal life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. I never ſaid the Letter could, or did give the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but <hi>the Spirit is given by it;</hi> or, as I even now expreſt it, the Spirit gives out himſelf by it; and he gives out Chriſt, or the knowledge of Chriſt and eternal life by it alſo; who ſhall hinder him, if he will begin and further our ſalvation by it?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is <hi>R.

Did ever any of the Apoſtles, or ſuch as had indeed immediate teachings from the Spirit, vilifie and reproach Chriſt, or the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, with ſuch inkhorn terms?</p>
                     <p>Yet again, <hi>With a Letter-fulneſs, thou wouldſt have no witneſs of God, without the Letter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. That follows not, for his providential works are witneſſes of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 17. to the very Heathens, and much more to Chriſtians; But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He ſhall be no Chriſtian to me, or in my account, who brings any teſtimony, as from God, without the Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atteſtation.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith <hi>R. F. If the Scripture be loſt, the fulneſs and the witneſs would be loſt, and his people be without ſupply and ſtrength, according to thy account.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Should they be loſt, that one way whereby God gives out his fulneſs, and by which he witneſſeth and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his peoples ſupply and ſtrength, would be loſt, yet God loſeth none of his fulneſs in himſelf; and Chriſt hath

                     <p n="2">2. Seeing there are Scriptures, as they cannot be broken, <hi>John</hi> 10. 35. they cannot be loſt; God hath, and will ever preſerve them, for his peoples ſupply and ſtrength.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What vain jangling is here from <hi>R.

                     <p>For thus <hi>R. F.</hi> gathers up the Rere of his forces, <note n="*" place="margin">Page 28.</note> 
                        <hi>He (to wit, Chriſt) is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt, and he is the Head of the body the Chruch, who is the beginning and firſt-born from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence, for in him the fulneſs dwells.</hi>

                     <p>

                     <p n="2">2. If ever he feels the power of theſe, as other Scriptures,<note place="margin">The Scripture magnifies Chriſt above it ſelf.</note> God will teach him, to honor the Scripture ſo much the more, as it magnifies Chriſt above it ſelf; and to ſpeak more wiſely of it, then to conclude as he doth: <hi>In him the fulneſs dwells, then not in the Letter, yet the Letter declares of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. If the Letter declares of Chriſts fulneſs, then we ſhall need to know no more of Chriſt, then what for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is in the Scripture; there is no neceſſity then of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate teachings, (ſetting Scripture aſide) nor ought we to receive any, againſt the Scripture.</p>

The fuller the fountain is, the more full is the conduit and its pipes: The more full the heart is, the fuller the mouth; out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh, and the pen writeth, what is good or bad, truth or error. In Chriſt is the fulneſs of the fountain, in the Scriptures is the fulneſs of the ſtream, flowing from, and carrying to the fountain, and

                     <p>The major, or firſt of the premiſed propoſitions, I may ſtrengthen from <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 29. Chriſt taught as one having authority: From 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> followed Chriſt: From <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 9. Holding faſt the faithful word, as he hath been taught, ('tis ſpoken of the Biſhop or preaching Elder) that he may be able by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort, and to convince gain-ſayers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 15. Theſe things ſpeak and exhort, (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> an Evangeliſt) and rebuke with all authority. So as if Chriſt taught with Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authority, in a way of <hi>Reaſon, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> &amp;c. and the Apoſtles after him, both practiſed and enjoyned this way to them, that ſucceeded them in after ages, we are to do the like.

Inſtances.</note> 61. 1. and 2. <hi>verſes,</hi> as we have it recorded, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. and applying it to the people at <hi>Nazareth;</hi> he gave them ſo much ſearching Doctrine and Uſe from it, that (as many of our hearers) ſome wondered, others were filled with wrath, none ſcoffed <hi>at his handling the Text ſo well,</hi> or that he had <hi>made ſo good matter of it,</hi> but they bare him witneſs, &amp;c. Let <hi>R.

He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living; let him minde the Uſe of confutation, Ye therefore do greatly erre: Or, let him read Chriſts Sermon upon the mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. &amp;c. and ſee if he gives not <hi>Reaſons</hi> for the Beatitudes, or bleſſed ſtate of the poor in ſpirit, the mourners, the meek, &amp;c. and <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> of all, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad; with the <hi>Motives,</hi> For great is your reward in heaven, for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets, &amp;c. Let him read <hi>Chap. 7. ver.</hi> 1.

With what judgement ye judge, ye ſhall be judged; The <hi>Tryal, ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5. which amounts to thus much, That he paſſeth not right judgement abroad, who begins not firſt at home, but lets the beam continue in his brothers eye. Let him read the book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and obſerve how <hi>Solomon</hi> firſt takes it up as his <hi>Text, Chap.</hi> 1. 2. Vanity of vanities, all is vanity; agreeable to that in <hi>Job</hi> 15. 31. and thence collects his main <hi>Point,</hi> Happineſs is not to be obtained by any thing under the Sun, which he proveth all along the Book; and then winds up with the general <hi>

                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2. Affirmatively, By faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, the price of a ſinners redemption, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4, and 5. The great <hi>

Another <hi>Point</hi> floweth from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>viz.</hi> of the neceſſity of Sanctification; and the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable connexion of it, with a juſtified ſtate, though it is no ingredient to conſtitute a juſtified perſon. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. and 7. are full of ſpiritual <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in the aſſerting of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary preſence of holineſs, in every believer, although ſin be
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115729:169"/> preſent in the ſame heart, warring and fighting, the believer muſt abide the conflict. Of both the <hi>Points, viz.</hi> of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Sanctification, the Apoſtle makes ſingular <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, Chap.</hi> 8. for conſolation of believers, both againſt ſin, and ſufferings: Againſt ſin, in reſpect of the guilt, <hi>that</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and aboliſhed; in reſpect of in-dwelling corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that</hi> reigns not, though it remains; againſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and afflictions, they ſhall all work to good, ſhall not ſeparate from the love of Chriſt, &amp;c. A third main <hi>Point</hi> is touching Election and Rejection, (in <hi>Chapters</hi> 9, 10, 11.) of whom the Lord pleaſed (before good or evil was in them) to chuſe, or paſs by, as a Potter, who hath power over his clay, &amp;c. leaving it as a depth not to be far waded into, but ſwim over it we may, with the arms of faith and admiration. And of all this Goſpel-doctrine (and what dependeth thereupon) he makes the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> from <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. to the end of the Epiſtle; exhorting unto Holineſs toward God, Righteouſneſs toward men, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.

By the mercies of God (juſtifying, ſanctifying mercy, the mercy of God, in calling and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, according to eternal predeſtination) I beſeech you, &amp;c.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. It is a truth, the light (which is light indeed, and not thought only to be light) in every mans conſcience is of God;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115729:173"/> but you ſhall have many men tell you, <hi>my light gives me to judge thus,</hi> and <hi>I think thus,</hi> when 'tis not light but darkneſs; for which end (to avoid this deceit) Chriſt gives the caution, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 35. Take heed therefore, that the light which is in thee, <hi>i. e.</hi> which thou thinkeſt is light, be not darkneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Granting that every man hath ſome light in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which is of God, ſo far as Magiſtrates Laws are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that light, that light will accord with the Laws, &amp; witneſs for them (at one time or other) But what if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Law be <hi>above</hi> the light that every man hath (as is the Law of true Religion, Chriſtian and ſaving Religion?) ſuppoſe every ſuch man (who hath but an inferior common light, beneath and below, the light of the Magiſtrates Law) doth witneſs againſt it not to be of God, is it not therefore of God? becauſe a blind erring conſcience who cannot ſee above his candle-natural light doth ſo judge of it, not to be of God, is it, I ſay, therefore not of God? or muſt the Magiſtrate repeal thoſe laws, which accord with Gods ſupernatural light given him, becauſe the natural man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach the underſtanding of them? Such laws indeed as have <hi>perſecuted, priſoned, crucified</hi> them who have ſuffered for the teſtimony of a good conſcience (if Rulers repealed them not) God hath <hi>hewed down in all ages,</hi> becauſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Law of God, and to that which was, and is in a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified conſcience; but the conſcience of every man is not a ſanctified conſcience; and therefore it may ſooner op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what is good in the Magiſtrates Laws, then the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates good Laws ſhall oppoſe any thing good in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And hereupon it follows, that the Magiſtrate is not to level his Laws with every mans conſcience, and light, but he is to provide and encourage able Teachers, who may by Gods bleſſing on their labors, be inſtrumental to elevate the mindes and conſciences of people to the underſtanding of that which is ſupernatural in the Law of God, and of man conſonant to that of God. But what ſay theſe men further? <note n="*" place="margin">Glory of the Lord &amp;c. pag. 15.</note> Becauſe there have been perſecuting Laws, <hi>Therefore be awarned of making Laws, and that you have no Law concerning Religion, but let Religion defend it ſelf; for whatſoever is not of God, will not ſtand, but will wither away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="307" facs="tcp:115729:173"/> but ſee that your Law be according to that in the conſcience, and then it will be againſt ſtrikers</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> Here is that which is wreathed and croſs-ſhakled; <hi>no law muſt be concerning Religion, yet all according to that in the conſcience;</hi> I ask theſe men again, Is Religion within, as well as without? if they ſay without, then why condemn they us who are for the outward part of worſhip inſtituted by God? if they ſay within, then where is it ſeated? every where but in the conſcience? if it be ſeated in the conſcience as in other faculties, then the Laws cannot reach the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but they will reach Religion alſo; And again if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be ſeated in the conſcience, why ſhould not laws be concerning Religion, and according thereunto, as according to the conſcience? ſeeing the conſcience bindeth us to the obſervation of Gods Law; and if the Magiſtrates Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, be according to Gods Law, the Law of the Magiſtrate and the Law of the Conſcience will agree very well together; for he is not a terror to them that do well, but to evill doers; yet his Law is for the <hi>defence</hi> of them that do well, as for the offence of them that do ill; &amp; it is the evil doer onely that is afraid of a good, a righteous, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Law. <hi>Secondly,</hi> for the diſcovery of <hi>R. F.</hi> his deceitful anſwer conſiſting of truth and error jumbled together; <hi>The Law of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>anſwers his juſtice, and the light in the conſcience, which anſwers the Law of God, which is perfect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in the conſcience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> Here are two truths, The Law of God anſwers his Juſtice, and the Law of God is perfect; but here are two errors couched withal.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As if the Law of God had no more perfection of light and holineſs then is in every mans conſcience; And,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As if the perfection of the Law was regulated by that in the conſcience; whereas the Law of God is above the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience<note place="margin">Gods Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> of man both in its light, and holineſs, and in its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; it being a Rule to the conſcience, from its ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of light and perfection of holineſs; and hence I conclude,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That if the Magiſtrates Law be according to the Law of God, although it be above the preſent light of conſcience, it is neither againſt the holineſs, nor true liberty of conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is one thing for the Magiſtrate to declare, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115729:174"/> (by his civil ſanction) Laws made, by God and Chriſt, concerning Religion, which are above the conſciences of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men, and above the actual preſent light of ſome true<note place="margin">Magiſtrates Laws not to be againſt, yet may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What if his Laws concerning Religion be above the preſent actual, or habitual degree of light that is in the Saints? This may be ſuppoſed; becauſe ſometimes the Light of the Magiſtrate may be elevated higher then the light of ſome real Saints; diſcerning further into the minde of Chriſt, and underſtanding his Laws better then many of Chriſts ſubjects, in as much as he may be more eminently ſubject to Chriſts Laws then inferior perſons; doth the Magiſtrate ſin in holding forth light, ſo agreeable to the Laws of Chriſt? I trow not. What then? may he compel all within the Nation or Commonwealth to come up in practiſe to his own light? no, neither: Here the Rule of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt take place to forbear, as he would and ought to be forborn in the like caſe; forbear, whom? ſuch as tenderly and<note place="margin">Magiſtrates forbearance of whom, and how.</note> peaceably diſſent for want of higher light; forbear, how?</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> in love to the Saints, and to all men: to the Saints, thereby to draw them up to higher attainments and actings, who are to make that uſe of ſuch forbearance; to all men, thereby to gain them in, who are of the Lords number, to Jeſus Chriſt, and to maintain a lawful civil peace with all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> not without reſtrictions over thoſe who deny the common principles of humane ſociety, diſturb the outward peace of the Saints ſocieties, &amp; would have Magiſtrates make Laws onely to binde and manacle themſelves from ſtriking at offenders, Blaſphemers, Goſpel and Church-diſturbers; that ſo the ſtrong man armed, ſtill keeping poſſeſſion, and holding men aſleep in a carnal and ſinful ſecurity, may have his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by naughty and pernicious inſtruments, to vent what he can againſt the Truth, without the leaſt outward check and controlment; but however, our hope and aſſurance is, that his kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot, ſhall not ſtand.</p>
